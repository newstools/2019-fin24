European stock markets were steady at the start of trading on Friday, awaiting a key Federal Reserve interest-rate meeting next week. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index dipped 0.1% to 7 334.55 points. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX 30 was flat at 12 412.27 points and the Paris CAC 40 edged up 0.1% to 5 647.63. The Fed is widely expected to deliver another cut in US interest rates next week, after chairperson Jerome Powell flagged up concerns over the economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's trade conflict with China. On Thursday, the European Central Bank unveiled a fresh round of economic stimulus and pushed interest rates further into negative territory in an effort to support the struggling eurozone economy.

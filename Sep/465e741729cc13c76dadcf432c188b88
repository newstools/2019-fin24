Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni will this year present hisÂ Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement on October 30, about a week later than is the norm. National Treasury and the chairperson of the Parliament's standing committee on finance, Joseph Maswanganyi, confirmed the date to Fin24 on Thursday.  At a post-Cabinet briefing on Thursday, Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu said such a move would not be a "train smash". "It is still within the period which the finance minister must make a medium term budget policy statement," he said. Later on Thursday, Treasury confirmed that the date had been shifted to accommodate international commitments by both the finance minister and President Cyril Ramaphosa. * This article has been updated to include Mthembu's comments as well as the reason for the shift.

Sales of private label food products in South Africa continues
to outstrip the growth in named brands, says Libstar. Libstar produces food under store labels for Shoprite,
Woolworths, Clicks, Spar and Pick n Pay. This area of its business accounts for almost half of its
revenue. The rest comes from its own brands like Denny and Lancewood cheese, as
well as products it produces for Nestlé, Unilever and others. In the
past six months to end-June, its headline earnings rose  by more than 12%, while revenue increased by
almost 5% to R4.6 billion. Libstar says it is receiving the benefits from new factories for
granola, health bars and sliced meats, that were completed last year. More
recently it commissioned a baking plant (which will deliver partially baked bread)
and a local manufacturing plant for Pringles chips. The local production of Kiri
and Laughing Cow soft cheese is expected to start in coming months. Listar warned of aggressive competitor discounting and
constrained demand in its markets, but said it looks set to grow its store
brands business. It launched 350 new or renovate products
during the past six months. By Wednesday mid-morning, Libstar’s share price was half a percent higher at 717c. The company's share price has been under pressure since its listing last year.

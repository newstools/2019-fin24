The strike by the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) does not affect British Airways flights operated by Comair in South Africa, a spokesperson for the airline confirmed on Monday. Comair operates under its low-fare airline brand, kulula.com, as well as under the British Airways livery, as part of a license agreement. Bloomberg reported earlier that British Airways cancelled hundreds of flights as chances dwindled for a breakthrough in negotiations with the BALPA. It was expected that disruptions will affect mainly London. The issue relates to a pay dispute.

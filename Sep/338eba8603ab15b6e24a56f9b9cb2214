The JSE fell on Wednesday amid a flurry of global political and growth risks which continue to erode confidence from skeptic investors. The reconvening of parliament in the United Kingdom further compounds the risk of Brexit, and in the USA an inquiry into the impeachment of Donald Trump was announced. These scenarios add more uncertainty to a global market which is struggling to come to terms with the impacts of the current trade war between China and the USA. In Asia, the Hang Seng lost 1.28%, Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.77% while the Nikkei lost a more modest 0.36%. The major indices in Europe tracked mostly lower on the day while in the USA the Dow Jones was the only index to post gains at the open. The rand took a tumble primarily on the back of US dollar strength. The local currency breached R15.00/$ as it peaked at a session low of R15.06/$, before it was recorded trading 0.92% lower at R14.99/$ at 17.00 CAT. The weaker rand set out the tone for most of the moves on the local bourse as most rand sensitives retreated.

Gold mines recorded another session of gains as the rand-denominated price of gold was bolstered by the weaker rand.

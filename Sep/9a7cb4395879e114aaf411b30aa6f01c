Lexi Monzeglio opened the first Lexi’s Healthy Eatery in Sandton in 2018. Within a year, she’s expanded to three branches. But her entrepreneurial journey wasn’t straightforward. Much like the concept of her plant-based restaurant, her success came very organically. finweek sat down with her at her newest restaurant in Rosebank Mall. You’re not a chef by training. How did your food journey start? After finishing my graphic design degree, I started a job in the marketing department of a financial services group. I wanted to eventually become a creative director or start my own agency, because I always loved art and design. I hated being at a desk, so one of the outlets I had in my first year of working was starting a food blog. I couldn’t cook at all. One of the only things I could make was brownies. So I ate out a lot, had tonnes of brownies and ended up gaining a bit of weight. My mother even told me I looked like a little bubble! That was the start of me becoming more health conscious. It wasn’t revolutionary; I started making very small changes to my diet and shared some of the recipes I was using on my blog. The more I cooked, the more I realised it’s another form of creative outlet and I loved using unusual flavour combinations. How did it develop from creative outlet to more? I changed jobs nearly once a year. I gained quite a bit of varied experience and moved up quite quickly as I moved companies. I didn’t have a BCom degree, so I did a project management course at Wits and used that to leverage me into a position as marketing manager, where I could manage events and the marketing team. I loved it because I didn’t have to be at a desk all day. All along my food blog had been ticking over. By this time, I loved food and I was also doing freelance food styling and recipe development. The more I did this, the more I thought, “I should do this”. Years ago, a friend of mine and I thought of opening a little restaurant together, but it was a pipedream. At the time we thought we’d need to save about R200 000 to make it happen. In hindsight that wouldn’t even have paid for the kitchen. So, a restaurant was always at the back of my mind, but it was a total dream. How did you move into the restaurant space? Through my freelance work, I started getting more restaurant clients, working on their social media strategy and also getting to know the kitchen processes. By that point I had also – not consciously – effectively gone vegan. I am more comfortable with the term plant-based now as I am far from a perfect vegan. All these things just kind of came together and I eventually started working for a start-up meal kit company. I developed over 100 recipes for them. But I realised this was also not what I wanted to do – it wasn’t creative and the recipes I was developing were not exclusively plant-based.               Why didn’t you give up the dream?  I got a call from my now business partner, Ezio Nichele. He had gotten my details through a mutual friend. He was planning to open a vegan restaurant and needed a vegan chef. Initially, I wasn’t sure about the idea, but I met up with him and it turned out that he had known my uncle for 15 years, and had even worked with him for a while, which already gave us a bit of a connection. He had a concept already, but I was so sure Lexi’s was the right idea for Joburg that I convinced him we should do that instead. And that’s how we partnered. We went in 50/50 – me with IP equity and Ezio with the financial capital. Your slogan is ‘Eat more plants’. Can you explain your menu? My vision was to encourage healthy eating. To create a plant-based menu that is accessible and affordable in South Africa. Overseas everyone is doing it. South Africa is almost there, but not quite, specifically not Joburg. The few vegan cafés or restaurants that have been around for a while in Joburg have definitely started rippling waves of change, but I think Joburgers are starting to get more serious about their diets and realising sustainability is important, so there's a bigger gap now. Vegan isn’t our only pillar. That’s why our menu works, because we still make a burger and fish, which makes it accessible. You’ve opened three restaurants in just over a year. Why do you think Lexi’s has been so successful? We’ve been really lucky in the combination of our skillsets; Ezio from an operational point of view, and me on the food and design side. Lexi’s Healthy Eatery works because the partnership works – and when we apply our different skills to the business, we always consult each other. Obviously, being the ‘first’ to launch something like this really helped us in terms of building quick success – people are ready and keen for something fresh and different. We also made sure not to position ourselves as strictly vegan – it appeals to a bigger market because people just want to eat healthier and more consciously. In fact, only about 10% to 15% of our clients are even vegan.

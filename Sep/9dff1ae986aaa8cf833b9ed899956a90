Peter Moyo showed up for work at the company's Sandton building on Monday morning, but was again barred from entering his office. The High Court in Johannesburg on Friday upheld an earlier ruling allowing the on-again, off-again Old Mutual CEO to return to work until the appeal process has been concluded. But Old Mutual disputed this in a statement on Friday night, claiming that Moyo did not challenge the contractual validity of his second sacking last month. Reuters reported on Monday morning that Moyo was again prevented from returning from his job. In a video shared by journalist Ray Mahlaka on Twitter, Moyo's lawyer Eric Mabuza says Old Mutual representatives took him and Moyo to a boardroom and told them that they were not allowed on the premises.   Mabuza is now demanding a resolution from the Old Mutual board that Moyo was barred from resuming his duties. Moyo was axed in June, with Old Mutual at the time citing a conflict of interest and a breakdown in trust. His dismissal was, however, found to be unlawful in July and he was temporarily reinstated, with Old Mutual barred from appointing a replacement. Nonetheless, he was prevented from going back to work the day after this initial court victory. In August, Old Mutual then fired Moyo for a second time, issuing him a further notice to terminate his employment contract – a move Moyo's legal team labelled a classic case of contempt of court. Old Mutual says that he can't go back to work until the court has ruled on the validity of the second termination. Compiled by Helena Wasserman

If you are
earning SA's average take-home pay in 2019 – that is, R14 177 per month – it will
take the world's richest self-made woman just seven minutes to earn what you
get in a year. Diane
Hendricks, who co-founded 700-store roofing company ABC Supply with her late
husband Ken Hendricks, is a businesswoman, occasional film producer, and has a net
worth of $6.3bn. And it takes her just one minute to earn what a minimum wage
earner in South Africa earns in a year (R42 000). It will
take reality star-turned-entrepreneur Kylie Jenner, meanwhile, just four
minutes to earn what the average South African takes home in a month. This is
according to a new wage
analysis tool developed by RS Components. Using data
from the Forbes’
richest self-made women list, RS Components designed a tool that allows
users to calculate how long it would take the women on the list to earn their
salary. The tool operates in US dollars and pounds sterling. Wealth analysis is not RS Components' core function. The
global components and tools supplier publishes a wide-ranging selection of
topics under the banner "Did you know?", Fin24
previously reported. Ranked below Hendricks on the list of big earners are IT
mogul Thai Lee; billionaire co-owner of food and drinks giant, The Wonderful Company,
Lynda Resnick; fast food chain CEO Peggy Cherng; 23andMe co-founder Anne
Wojcicki; former eBay chief Meg Whitman; and Jenner. Bio-Rad Laboratories founder Alice Schwartz – aged 92 – and health
software billionaire Judy Faulkner are also listed.

Flyt Property Investment, Cape Town's newest property development brand, was launched on Tuesday. The brand originates out of an alliance between Proventus Propertyâ€™s Zane De Decker and private equity investors who have valued and supported his work in the past.  De Decker says their strategy is one of finding only meaningful opportunities that challenge the status quo. "It's important for us to achieve returns in every sense," he says. "Not only do we want to achieve attractive financial yields, but it is also essential that we uplift local businesses, improve the built environment and facilitate positive progress in the areas we work in." The Flyt partnership is focused on the Cape Town area, spanning residential, hospitality, industrial and commercial projects. Their newest development, Eaton Square, situated in Diep River, consists of 66 sectional title apartments. Their alternative co-living model incorporates a fully-managed "plug and play" concept targeted at the younger generation. Due to launch in early 2020, Wink Apartments, a Foreshore development consisting of 30 residential units and retail space, will include an allotted portion of rooms available to the Airbnb-type hospitality rental market. Pipeline developments and projects include a property in Rosebank and a mixed-use development in Buitengracht Street, Cape Town. The group has indicated that they will soon be launching a Section12J property fund aimed at interested investors.

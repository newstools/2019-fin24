The South African Chamber of Commerce said in a statement released on Saturday that it would convene a meeting with the South African Police Service's top brass and captains of industry on Monday to discuss the violent looting of foreign-owned businesses. The meeting will take place after a week during which stores and other small businesses owned and run by foreign nationals were looted in what has been slammed as xenophobic violence. The violence has drawn international outrage and prompted retaliatory action from other African states. The statement said major companies with African operations were affected by the developments in SA, adding that the destruction of property and maiming of people effected business operators in SA and other African jurisdictions. "It is expected that after the meeting with the SAPS top brass, a press conference will be held at which the top executives will be reading out their respective statements condemning these xenophobic attacks, and the wanton destruction of property and killing of people," the statement said. The statement said SACCI invited representatives of Multichoice, MTN, Vodacom, Coca- Cola, AB-InBev, Absa, Standard Bank, Liberty, Old Mutual, Shoprite Checkers, Builders Warehouse, Deloitte, EY, FNB, Investec, IDC, DBSA, Brand SA, The DTIâ€™s Invest SA, Dirco, The Nigeria SA Chamber of Commerce, Total SA and BP.

Struggling SA retail giant, Edcon, has been given the green light to sell its shareholding in Zimbabwe-based
clothing chain Edgars to Mauritius incorporated entity SSCG Africa Holdings, as
the group realigns operations in a bid to stay afloat. Edcon faced a possible collapse before agreeing a
R2.7bn deal with lenders, South African landlords and the Public Investment
Corporation as part of a restructuring plan to save the group. It has now
been given the nod to dispose the Zimbabwe operations by that
country's Competitions and Tariff Commission. Edgars owned a 41%
stake in Edgars Zimbabwe, the biggest clothing retailer in the southern African
country. Edgars has 25 branches located throughout the country. It also
controls 25 Jet Stores, club micro-finance and Carousel garment manufacturing
factory in Bulawayo. In its Board resolution, released on Monday, the Competition and Tariff Commission said it had approved the
merger "without conditions". The proposed
transaction is an acquisition by SSCG Africa Holdings of 100% shareholding in
Bellfield which in turn, owns 41.07% shares in Edgars. Bellfield is an investment vehicle that
holds shareholding in Edgars and is in turn wholly owned by Edcon Limited. "As a result of
the acquisition, SSCG will have a direct control in Edgars," reads the
Board resolution.Â SSCG is an investor in the
low-cost African airline Fastjet.

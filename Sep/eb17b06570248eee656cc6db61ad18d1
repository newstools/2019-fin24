OUTsurance will sell its New Zealand insurance business, Youi
New Zealand, to Tower Insurance, that country's third largest
general insurer. “The sale provides an opportunity for Youi to unlock value
on favourable terms and, going forward, will allow the Youi group to focus on its
Australian business where the greater scale and diversity of the market offers more growth
opportunities for a challenger brand like Youi.” OUTsurance launched Youi Australia, a short-term insurer, in 2008. The sale price range is between NZ$10 million (R94m) and
NZ$13m (R122m). More importantly, the company said that the sale will release capital of more
than R400m allocated to the New Zealand business. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is
expected to close in the fourth quarter 2019. Read: Fewer car accidents as SA drivers change their habits,

Eskom announced Mandla Maleka as its new interim group treasurer
in a statement that the state—owned power utility released on Sunday. Maleka's appointment comes after Andre Pillay left the
company at the end of his tenure on Friday. The Eskom statement said Maleka joined Eskom 20 years ago
from the National Treasury's Budget Office. "He is currently the company’s chief economist and head of portfolio
management and foreign exchange trading, largely responsible for the hedging of
all Eskom's forex derivatives and commodities," the Eskom statement said. Eskom CFO Calib Cassim said in the statement that he was confident
that Maleka would successfully hold the fort until a permanent group treasurer
is appointed.

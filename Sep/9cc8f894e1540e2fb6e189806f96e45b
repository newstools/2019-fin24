The JSE advanced on Thursday along with other global stocks
as investors were optimistic on the back of the European Central Bank's rate
decision. Focus was primarily on the ECB which cut the deposit rate by
10 basis points to -0.50% and announced a restart to its quantitative easing
program from November 1, with net purchases of 20 billion euros per month. The US and China are taking steps to ease trade tensions
between the two sides ahead of their scheduled meetings in the coming weeks,
with both sides announcing delays and exclusions in some of the tariffs which
are due to kick in soon. This positive sentiment saw markets in Asia close
mostly firmer while in the US the major indices opened marginally higher. On the currency market, the euro against the greenback
advanced following the ECB's press conference. This saw the rand also gain

Emerging markets will again be looking to central banks to provide the next leg-up in a rally that’s making it the best September so far for stocks and currencies since 2013. That’s assuming there’s no conflagration between the US and China over trade, no panic over the slump in Saudi Arabia's oil production, and no signs that global growth is slowing more than anticipated. The Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan decisions on Wednesday and Thursday will be key to sentiment, while a string of economic reports from China will also be a major driver. Not forgetting interest-rate decisions in Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia. “Continued easing in the context of growth stabilisation would likely be a very compelling setting for emerging markets,” said Morgan Harting, a New York-based money manager at AllianceBernstein, which manages $581 billion. “However, to the extent central banks deliver more stimulus than expected because growth is worse than expected, it would be hard to see emerging-market assets delivering very strong returns.”  Developing-nation stocks, as measured by a MSCI index, climbed for a fourth week to break above their 200-day moving average on Friday, heralding further gains. Meantime, a gauge of emerging-market currencies approached its 50-day average after advancing 1.6% since end-August. The European Central Bank said Thursday it would restart quantitative easing. “While much of the chatter will be about the Fed, more and more emerging-market investors are likely to pick up on this and reduce underweights,” Harting said. “To the extent we start to see greater evidence of stabilization in EM activity and the forward-looking earnings outlook, I think EM could begin to outperform meaningfully.”

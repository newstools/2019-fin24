Economic growth in Africa’s largest oil producer
slowed for the third consecutive quarter, adding further pressure on the
government to fight rising poverty. Gross domestic product expanded 1.94% in the three
months through June from a year earlier, the Abuja-based National Bureau of
Statistics said in a report on its website Tuesday. That compares with a
revised expansion of 2.1% in the first quarter and a median estimate of 2.46%
in a Bloomberg survey. Growth is at its lowest level since the third quarter of
2018. The oil sector, which accounts for 10% of economic
output, expanded by 5.15%. That’s the quickest pace since the third quarter of
2018, even as crude output was little changed at 1.98 million barrels per day. "The recovery in oil GDP looks promising,"
Razia Khan, Standard Chartered Bank’s chief economist for Africa and the Middle
East, said in an emailed statement. "However, given softer oil prices in
subsequent quarters this pace of growth may not be sustained."    After a few years of massive spending to boost the economy following a 2016
contraction, Nigeria’s Senate approved a reduced budget for 2019 as the
government struggles to meet revenue targets. The central bank has stepped in to support expansion, first with an
interest-rate cut in March and thereafter by forcing lenders through
regulations and penalties to extend more credit, especially to to small- and
medium-sized businesses and households. "Firmer GDP recovery will require stronger, largely fiscal and reform
stimulus," Khan said. "Monetary easing alone is unlikely to be
sufficient."

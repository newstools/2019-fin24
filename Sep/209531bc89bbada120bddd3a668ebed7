As much as R60 billion could be invested in the South African
vehicle and component manufacturing industries in the next five years, according
to Andrew Kirby, CEO of Toyota South Africa and president of National Association
of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA). In a recent speech at the annual NAAMSA Conference in Kyalami, Kirby
said the seven largest vehicle manufacturers are considering  R40 billion in direct investments, with an
additional R20 billion earmarked for component making. The industry wants to increase the use of locally-produced components in vehicles. "We expect local procurement to grow by R12.6 billion in
the next five years together with a 14% increase in direct employment, which
equates to creating another 16 000 jobs, mainly in the component
manufacturing sector as local content grows from 39% to at least 42%." The component sector needed to urgently develop smaller  suppliers, Kirby added, and the
industry wants to help establish 500 smaller suppliers with 130 of them black owned.
The industry also welcomes an initiative by the local steel industry to
investigate the production of automotive-grade steel in SA. He stressed the importance of being globally competitive in
terms of cost, quality, and reliability of supply as several other countries
were eyeing South Africa's automotive export markets. "Growing production volumes, increasing localisation
significantly and using the latest technologies in all aspects of the business
are vital to transform the South African automotive industry and to this end
the aim was increase output from the 610 000 vehicles made in 2018 to
800 000 in 2023,"  Kirby said. July's trade data showed a 22% monthly increase in exports of vehicles and transport equipment, to the value of R3 billion. Some 407 000 people are employed in the vehicle industry.

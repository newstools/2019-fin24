It is typically a "fund-of-funds" that it invests in venture capital companies with a history of developing small businesses, Fin24's Ferial Haffajee previously reported. The SA SME Fund's CEO Ketso Gordhan leads a team of six executive managers. The fund's board of directors include SA businessman and Discovery CEO Adrian Gore, Eskom acting CEO and chairperson Jabu Mabuza and businesswoman, author and chancellor of Wits University, Judy Dlamini.

US president Donald Trump will convene a meeting Wednesday on vaping, according to a person familiar with the matter, after reports of hundreds of US cases of a mysterious illness that’s sickened and killed people who have used e-cigarette devices. The person asked not to be identified because the meeting does not appear on Trump’s public schedule for the day. A White House spokesman declined to comment. More than 450 cases of the respiratory condition were reported as of September 6, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The severity of the cases vary, but six people have died. Fox Business Network reported earlier that Trump was planning a meeting on vaping and the recent reports of illness.

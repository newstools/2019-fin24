Thanks in part to steep cost cutting and new business growth,
Momentum Metropolitan (previously known as MMI Holdings) has seen a sharp increase
in its profitability. The insurer hiked its diluted normalised headline earnings by
53% to R3.1 billion for
the year ended 30 June 2019 thanks to efficiency improvements and lower
life insurance claims – but also because the “operating basis changes and
investment variances” in the previous year. Excluding the impact of this, normalised headline earnings
improved by 21% year-on-year. This was despite a 31% increase in losses – to almost half a
billion rand - at its “new initiatives” unit, which includes its health insurance
joint venture in India, and aYo (a mobile insurance joint venture with MTN in African
countries). But its new business volumes increased by 12%, and headline
earnings from Momentum Life jumped by 87%, while profit from Momentum
Investments and Metropolitan Retail more than doubled. The group said Momentum Life benefitted
from “updated product pricing”, while Metropolitan Retail’s growth was
supported by increased adviser productivity and a higher proportion of policies
with premiums collected via salary deduction While the group has been on a drive to cut costs in recent
years, it acknowledged in its results that “cost reductions on its own have its
limitations". "We shall in the coming years rely more heavily on revenue growth. This will
be challenging in the current environment, and single-digit earnings growth for F2020
might be a fair result." The board has extended Hillie Meyer’s tenure as group CEO until
June 2023.

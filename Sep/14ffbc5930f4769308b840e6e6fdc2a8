Net1 [JSE: NT1], the
company behind Cash Paymaster Services that used to run SA's social
grant payment system, has been left deep in the red following the loss
of that contract. It reported on Friday
morning that its revenue in rand dropped by 40%, while it suffered an operation
loss of $15.6m (R234m), compared to a profit of $10m in the previous year. The company says this was primarily due to the expiration of
its SASSA contract, and it also incurred $1m in retrenchment costs
during the past quarter. CPS stopped disbursing social grants in October after the Constitutional Court ordered government to stop the contract, which
had been declared invalid in 2014. The SA Post Office took over the distribution
of welfare grants worth R150bn a year. Net1 was also hit by Cell Câ€™s woes. Net1, which
holds 15% of Cell C, last week wrote
down the value of the struggling mobile operator to zero. The company also focuses on salary
distributions, money transfers and bill payments.

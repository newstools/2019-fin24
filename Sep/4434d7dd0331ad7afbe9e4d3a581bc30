The department of home affairs says that compulsory budget cuts will not mean it has to close any of its offices, but will have a "negative impact on the filling of some posts". Minister of Home Affairs, Aaron Motsoaledi, confirmed his department was facing compulsory budget cuts in reply to a Parliamentary question from the DA's Joseph McGluwa. "Budget cuts will have a negative impact on the filling of some posts, but we are not envisioning closure of any Home Affairs office," he said.  Details of the cuts are contained in a document published by National Treasury in June. The paper provides national departments and public entities with guidelines of how to prepare their budget submissions. It refers to a compulsory budget baseline reduction scenario of: Departments must show how they can make cuts with the least impact for service delivery, and must suggest "non-priority programmes and projects to be scaled down or closed.

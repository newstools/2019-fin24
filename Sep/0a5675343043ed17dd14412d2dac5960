China will announce moves to ease the negative impact of the trade war, Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin said on Twitter Wednesday, as the world’s two biggest economies inflict higher tariffs on each others’ goods. "Based on what I know, China will introduce important measures to ease the negative impact of the trade war," Hu said, without specifying what the policies will be. “The measures will benefit some companies from both China and the US."  The tweet came as the top negotiators from the two countries are set to restart face-to-face negotiations in the coming weeks. Hu is editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid published by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily. He told Bloomberg earlier that his tweets, which are "based on what I know" are "definitely true".

In a paper released in
August, entitled Transformation, Inclusive Growth and Competitiveness:
Towards an Economic Strategy for South Africa, Finance Minister Tito
Mboweni promised to renew his focus on taking small business growth in
South Africa seriously - and it's been a hot topic ever since. This policy paper talks to several strategic moves
that will be put in place to effectively turn our economy around. For starters,
it mentions reducing red tape by 25% over the next five years through
revisiting the Red Tape Impact Assessment Bill, and introducing late payment
penalties on government departments that are taking too long to pay small
businesses for their services. Interestingly, Mboweni also talks about lowering the
barriers to entry and addressing distorted patterns of ownership through
increased competition, and he proposes the following approaches to help realise this: As this sector is a prime focus for Riversands
Incubation Hub, we’ve seen many small businesses grow in spite of the state of the economy,
and believe this is due to the fact that they are more agile and better able to
weather tough times by spotting the rays of opportunity through the clouds. Knowing this sector as well as we do, we believe there
are several areas that should be taken into account in the finalisation and
deployment of Mboweni’s plan.   On the face of it, our government seems to have
its heart in the right place, but this plan needs to be firmed up and followed
up with action.  * Jenny Retief is CEO of Riversands Incubation Hub. Views expressed are her own.

The JSE shrugged off the pessimism in other global indices as it surged higher on Monday. Bearishness crept up in most global markets following the attack on a Saudi Arabian oil pipeline over the weekend which is estimated to affect at least 5% of global oil supply. In a world economic climate which is currently being shrouded by trade war concerns, this latest development saw investors  shun riskier assets such as stocks. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index and the Hang Seng fell 0.37% and 0.83% respectively, while the Nikkei was closed for a public holiday. In Europe, equities tracked mostly lower, while major US indices also opened softer. Emerging market currencies fell out of favour as investors sought stronger currencies such as the greenback. The rand fell to a session low of R14.71/$ before it was recorded trading 0.18% weaker at R14.58/$ at 17.00 CAT. Oil and gas producer Sasol [JSE:SOL] was buoyed by the surge in energy commodity prices which subsequently saw the stock close 9.85% higher at R306.00. RCL Foods [JSE:RCL] also saw significant gains, rallying 8.11% to close at R10.00. Aspen Pharmacare [JSE:APN] advanced 5.68% to close at R99.99, while African Oxygen [JSE:AFX] rose 4.91% to close at R20.72 primarily on the back of a decent set of half-year results. Despite the softer rand,  financials advanced on the day which saw stocks such as Nedbank [JSE:NED] gain 5.32% to close at R251.24, while FirstRand [JSE:FSR] climbed 4.6% to close at R67.75.

The ANC's head of economic transformation, Enoch Godongwana, is the new chairperson of the board of the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). The decision was taken following the bank's annual general meeting on Friday, it announced in the JSE Stock Exchange News Service (SENS). Godongwana was serving as a non-executive director of the board of the DBSA which provides developmental infrastructure in South Africa and the rest of the African continent. His appointment by Cabinet as a non-executive director was slammed by DA finance spokesperson Alf Lees in April. He described it as "a huge blow to the impartiality of the bank that a deployed cadre of the ANC is now on the board" and an indication that the ANC continues to be a "vehicle for corruption, nepotism and cadre deployment". Gondongwana, who has an MSc in Financial Economics from the University of London, was deputy public enterprises minister from 2009 to 2010 and deputy economic development minister from November 2010 to 2012. He is currently a non-executive director of the New Development Bank, the South African National Housing Finance Corporation, Mondi PLC, National Home Builders Registration Council, Zabezolo Leisure and Services, Zabezolo Investments, Zabezolo Resources, Zabezolo Properties and Zabezolo Group. The DBSA also announced that Prof Mark Swilling will be the deputy chair, while Martie Jacoba Janse van Rensburg is the new chair of the audit and risk committee. The DBSA's key focus areas are water, energy, transport and ICT. - Compiled by Adiel Ismail

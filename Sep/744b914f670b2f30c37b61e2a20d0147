Knowledge and experience in the ICT sector pertaining to blockchain, the Internet of Things and cybersecurity would be advantageous. SITA procures ICT services for government departments. City Press recently reported that there have been allegations of irregularities in procurement contracts, which implicated senior managers and board members. News24 has previously reported that SITA admitted a tender for police forensic light sources was irregular. In June last year SITA management briefed Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) on applications to deviate from procurement guidelines in some cases, Fin24 previously reported. Entities must apply to National Treasury for approval to deviate from procurement guidelines. Deviations are allowed in exceptional circumstances, for example emergency procurement or if entities are dealing with a sole supplier. In the 2017/18 financial year, a quarter of SITA's total bids led to deviations from procurement guidelines, Fin24 reported.

Hong Kong stocks ended Monday marginally lower, with Chinese easing measures and expectations for another US interest rate cut offset by profit-taking and worries about long-running protests in the city. The Hang Seng Index inched down 9.36 points to 26 681.40. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.84% to 3 024.74 and the Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, jumped 1.91% to 1 689.21.

International ICT solutions and services group Datatec on Tuesday said its subsidiary, Logicalis Group, has acquired two businesses in Europe, adding to its growing footprint in the region. Logicalis took up a 70% interest in Cilnet, a Cisco systems integrator and managed services business based in Portugal; and Orange Networks, which is a Microsoft services business focused on Microsoft cloud and managed services, in Germany. The company said a stake in Cilnet would increase its Cisco technical expertise for the Iberian region, and complement the existing Spanish operation with data centre, collaboration, networking, infrastructure and managed services capabilities. Cilnet was founded in 2000 and has over 90 employees, including eight Cisco Certified Internet work Experts (CCIEs). The company designs and integrates networking, data centre and contact centre solutions, complemented with security, managed services and application development skills. Cilnet has annual revenue of approximately €20m, while Orange Networks' sit at around €5m. "Both these acquisitions bring additional expertise and experience that will prove valuableto Logicalis’ existing client base in Europe. "Cilnet will augment our Cisco offerings across the whole region of Iberia, increasing our capabilities and expanding our service portfolio," said Datatec CEO, Jens Montanana. "Orange Networks’ Microsoft Azure skill sets in the cloud space will provide additional expertise and experience both in Germany and other parts of Europe." Both Logicalis Group and its JSE-listed parent company, Datatec, have made notable acquisitions in recent years.

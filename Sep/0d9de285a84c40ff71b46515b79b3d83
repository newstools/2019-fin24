President Cyril Ramaphosa will brief world leaders and human
rights champions including Graca Machel and former Prime Minister of Norway Gro
Harlem Brundtland on South Africa's introduction of National Health Insurance,
a statement from the Presidency said on Sunday. The statement said Ramaphosa will meet with the group, known
as The Elders on Tuesday in Cape Town. The controversial NHI bill has been made
public for comment and political parties are grappling over modalities by which
universal healthcare ought to be provided. The statement said The Elders would be engaging with the
details of the proposed National Health Insurance to see if the draft measures
up to the standards of a sustainable and financially viable healthcare system,
as determined by the World Health Organisation. "The World Health Organisation defines universal health care
as meaning all people and communities can use the promotive, preventive,
curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services they need, of
sufficient quality to be effective. "At the same time, the use of these services should not
expose users to financial hardship," the statement said. The statement said The Elders will meet with Minister of
Health Zweli Mkhize to engage with government leaders, health sector leaders
and civil society to understand South Africa's journey to universal health coverage
with the introduction of National Health Insurance. "Parliament is currently engaged in public consultation on
the National Health Insurance Bill which envisages access to health care based
on values of justice, fairness and social solidarity," the statement said. The delegation of The Elders will meet Parliamentâ€™s portfolio
committee on health and Ramaphosa to discuss how best South Africa can
introduce health reforms that will lead to universal health coverage.

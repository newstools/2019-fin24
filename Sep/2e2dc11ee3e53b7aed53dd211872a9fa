European stock markets slid at the open on Wednesday as investor caution set in before the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision. In initial deals, the British capital's benchmark FTSE 100 index nudged 0.1% lower to 7 315.13 points compared with the closing level on Tuesday. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX 30 also reversed 0.1% to 12 359.39 points and the Paris CAC 40 fell 0.2% to 5 605.23. Expectations are running high for the US Federal Reserve to deliver the year's second interest rate cut later on Wednesday, as it concludes a hotly-anticipated monetary policy meeting.

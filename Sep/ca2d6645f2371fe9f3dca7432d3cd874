South African National Parks says it has a resolved a wage depute with employees and is fully "open for business". Employees had threatened a protest at the gates of the Kruger National Park on Friday, but the SANParks says the dispute around pay and conditions of employment has been resolved. Rey Thakhuli, the group's acting head of communications, said a collective agreement had been concluded and signed between the conservation authority and the Health and Other Service Personnel Trade Union (HOSPERSA) and the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers Union (NUPSAW).    “The details of the signed deal mean that workers will get an 8% salary adjustment and improved benefits,” said Thakhuli. “We want to also encourage those intending to visit our parks, we are open for business, come and enjoy your natural heritage," said the Chief Executive Officer of SANParks, Fundisile Mketeni.

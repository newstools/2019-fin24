For those with R31.5m in their back pocket, take a look at what you will get in this two-bedroom apartment - up for sale as fully furnished - in Cape Town's Atlantic Seaboard suburb of Clifton. The apartment consists of a master bedroom, a guest room and a room that was converted into a study. It has three bathrooms in total as well as a guest toilet. The apartment is situated in a contemporary complex and flanked on either side by the Twelve Apostles mountainside. Furthermore, it offers panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean. The panoramic exterior allows you to feel as though you are hovering right above the water's surface.

(Supplied) According to OKHA director Adam Court, the objective was to individualise the space with a "quiet opulence". OKHA also designed key items of bespoke handmade furniture for the apartment.  (Supplied) The aim was to create a cool and restful space in contrast to the bright, sunlit exterior. Table Mountain's granite, fynbos and dappled woods are evoked throughout the apartment in a palette of natural timbers, stones and metals, which are contrasted with plush velvets and linens on the walls, floors and furniture coverings. All the artwork accessories and objects are from Cape-based artisans.  (Supplied)

Liberty Two Degrees (L2D), which owns some of South Africa’s
biggest malls, released a trading update on Friday, which showed that Sandton
City continues to see strong trading growth despite the weak state of the
economy. Trade density (which measures sales per rentable square
metre in a mall) grew by 7.9% in Sandton City in the year to end-June, while Nelson
Mandela Square, which directly adjoins Sandton
City, saw growth of 6.5%. Its Botshabelo Mall saw growth of more
than 11%. But trade density in Eastgate fell by more than percent.  While Sandton City’s vacancy rate remains low at 0.6%, L2D’s
overall vacancy rate is 4.6% of gross leasable area, with retail (2.3%) having a
much lower vacancy rate than offices (9.8%). Earlier this week, its
competitor Growthpoint reported an overall
vacancy rate of 6.8%. Edcon represents 8.2% of L2D’s total retail space, but that
percentage still includes 5,600 square metres which has been returned to
Eastgate. Edcon wil pay rent on the space until the end of the year. Woolworths
now represents 9.2% of L2D’s total retail space, followed by The Foschini Group
(5.5%),  Shoprite Checkers (5.3%) and Massmart
(3.8%)  The company says South African retail environment remains on
a slow recovery path and that online retail (a threat to malls all over the
world) has grown in appeal in South Africa, albeit not at the same pace as
experienced in developed markets.

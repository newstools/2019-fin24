In a statement on Friday, packaging group Nampak [JSE: NPK] said it
has entered into a R1.5bn deal to sell its glass business. Nampak Glass primarily manufactures beer, spirits and wine
bottles, as well as water and juice bottles, and food jars. Its manufacturing
facility at Roodekop in Johannesburg produces glass containers that vary from 200ml
to 1.5 litre, and has a total capacity of 285,000 tons. The buyer is Isanti Glass. The black-owned investment group
Kwande owns 60% of the company, while SABSA – the holding company of South
African Breweries – holds the rest. Nampak will use the proceeds from the deal to help settle
debt. In its
latest trading update, Nampak reported that the revenue of its glass business for
the past 11 months grew by single digits, while volumes remained relatively
flat constrained by production output.

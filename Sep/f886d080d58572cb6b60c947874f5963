Bidvest [JSE: BVT], which does business in a
number of sectors including freight, services, office supplies and banking, has
hiked its
headline profit for the year to end-June by 10% to R4.6 billlion. This is despite flat group revenue,
which remained virtually unchanged at R77.2 billion. A strong focus on costs helped
to boost its gross profit margin from 28.9% to 29.8%. Last month, Bidvest hiked its interest
in the pharmaceutical company Adcock Ingram to 50.1%. Adcock produces brands
like Panado, Corenza and Bio-Plus. In the past year, Adcock achieved “strong
profitability gains”, Bidvest said. Bidvest
also holds a 27% stake in Comair, and will benefit from SAA’s undertaking
earlier this year to pay Comair more than R1 billion to settle a claim over SAA's anticompetitive conduct between 1999 and 2005. Bidvest’s services division – which includes the UK and Irish
outsourcing group Noonan, Protea Coin, BidAir Services and Bidvest Lounges –
saw its trading profit grow by 12.5% to R2.2 billion, but its freight division’s
trading profit for the year rose by only 3.8% to R1.4 billion. Bidvest
Bank had a “reasonable year”, with Bidvest’s financial services unit reporting trading
profit for the year was 7.5% down at R584.5 million. A 5.6% increase in final dividend
(318c) was declared.

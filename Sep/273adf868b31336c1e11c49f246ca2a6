The JSE swung into gains towards the close on Tuesday before closing flat, following a session where it traded mostly softer. Locally the focus was on South Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) numbers for the second quarter.  The economy recorded better than expected growth of 3.1% quarter-on-quarter compared to the consensus estimate of 2.4% growth.

Despite this GDP data, there was some gloom following the release of the ABSA Manufacturing PMI which fell to 45.7 from a prior recording of 52.1. The improved GDP numbers as well as a weaker US dollar saw the rand advance to a session high of R15.07 against the greenback, before retreating to trade 0.73% firmer at R15.12/$ at 17.00 CAT. Stocks on the JSE were rather mixed in Tuesday's session but notable gains were recorded for Aspen Pharmacare [JSE:APN] following the release of a trading statement which highlighted a decrease in net debt and a positive cash flow.

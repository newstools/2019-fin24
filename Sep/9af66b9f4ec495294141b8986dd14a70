Apple said its original video service, Apple TV+, would launch November 1 in more than 100 countries, as the iPhone maker moves into a new segment challenging streaming giants such as Netflix. The new service priced at $4.99 month will launch with a "powerful and inspiring lineup of original shows, movies and documentaries," according to an Apple statement released at a media event. Apple said customers who purchase an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod touch or Mac will get the first year of the service for free.

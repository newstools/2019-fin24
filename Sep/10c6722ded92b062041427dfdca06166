A former KPMG LLP partner has been sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison for defrauding an accounting regulator by recruiting insiders to get information on which of the firm’s audits would face inspection. David Middendorf, KPMG’s former US national managing partner for audit quality and professional practice, was convicted in March of recruiting Public Company Accounting Oversight Board insiders to pass along information on the audits.

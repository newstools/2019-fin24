As from Wednesday, petrol will be increasing by 11c per litre
for both 93 and 95, while diesel will be increasing by 26c per litre, Minister
of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe has said. Illuminating paraffin will be increasing by 24c per litre
wholesale. The main reason for the fuel price increase is the weakening
of the rand against the US dollar on average, he added. The depreciation of the
rand led to a higher contribution to the basic fuel price on petrol, diesel and
illuminating paraffin by more than 50c, he said. *Â Compiled by Marelise van der Merwe

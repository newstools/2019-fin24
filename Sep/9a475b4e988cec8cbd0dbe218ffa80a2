AVI, which owns brands like Bakers, Five Roses, I&J and
the shoe retailers Spitz and Green Cross, saw its headline earnings decline by  almost 5% in a tough year. Group revenue for the year to end-June rose by only 1.2%,
while cash generated by operations fell by almost 2% to R2.64bn. Net debt at
the end of June 2019 was R2.44bn compared to R1.27bn in the previous year. The company says consumer spending remains under pressure
and sales volumes fell in many of its businesses, amid “aggressive competitor
discounting”. These were some of the highlights from its results: “Our expectation is
that many of our categories will continue to have low, or even negative, growth
rates until there is a meaningful improvement in the economy,” However the group wants to achieve profit growth in the
current year, and says it secured foreign currency and key raw materials for
the majority of the year’s requirements “at levels that support sound levels of
profitability”. It singled out lower rooibos and butter prices than it saw in
the 2019 financial year. Compiled by Helena Wasserman

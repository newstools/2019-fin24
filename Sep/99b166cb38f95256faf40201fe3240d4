The South African company Bell Equipment, which offers the world's largest range of articulated dump trucks, reported an 8%
increase in revenue to R4.04bn for the six months to end-June. Its headline earnings per share rose by 25% to 164c, which
the company says is “reasonable” given the tough operating and economic
conditions in many of its markets. In South Africa, trading conditions deteriorated further on
the back of “prolonged policy uncertainty and a lack of much-anticipated
economic stimulus”. “Global demand was not as strong as anticipated, and this
led to higher inventory and debt levels than planned and a resultant increase
in financing costs. Production volumes have been reduced in line with expected
demand, and inventory and debt levels will normalise in the coming months,” the
company said in a statement. In the UK, Bell says the pound weakness has hurt its margins.
“The group is monitoring the situation around Brexit and what impact that could
have on future equipment demand.” North America remains a key area for growth. Its interim dividend remains the same as last year, at 20c a
share.

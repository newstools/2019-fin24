Capitec [JSE: CPI] increased its headline profit by 20% to R2.9bn for
the six months to end-August, with its dividend up 20c to 755c. It added 200,000 new clients per month over the past six
months, and now has 12.6m active clients. Transaction income grew by 12%, despite a reduction in its
transaction fees via its app. Some 6.8 million clients now use its digital
services, primarily via its banking app, from 4.7m last year.  The number of app transactions doubled to 290m. By comparison, 6 million clients visit its 834 branches every
month. At 122 branches, the cashier has been replaced by a full self-help
functionality. “This enabled us to add an additional consultant workstation for
further capacity in the branch.” Some 21 new branches will open in the next few
months. Retail deposit growth of 23% to R81.4bn, with R2.28bn paid
out in interest on retail call deposits, fixed deposits and positive credit
card accounts over the past six months. Since the product launch, in May 2018, more than 1 million
Capitec funeral plan policies have been issued and during the last 2 months,
100 000 policies per month. Of the total policies issued, 67% are active. “To date, the claims experience and policies that lapse are
lower than expected due to the book being in the early stages of maturity,”
Capitec said. While its gross loans increased by 17% to R60.3bn, Capitec became
stricter in granting credit which helped to curb arrears of up to 3 months –
which decreased by 11% to R2.16bn. But gross loans and advances in arrears by more than 3
months and loans with legal statuses (debt review and handed over) more than
doubled – from R3bn to almost R7bn. Capitec said that this was due to the new
accounting standard IFRS 9. Previously, loans were written off when they were
more than 3 months in arrears or had a legal status. Since the implementation of
IFRS 9 on 1 March 2018, loans are only written off when there is no reasonable
expectation of further recovery beyond 5% of the gross balance at write-off.
Loans therefore remain on book for longer and this resulted in the increase in
stage 3 loans that are more than 3 months in arrears. Its gross credit card book grew by 71% to R4.55bn – 3.6% of
the total South African retail credit card market. Currently clients can
qualify for credit limits of up to R250 000 with interest rates as low as
prime. Capital expenditure has increased to R804 million at August
2019 (August 2018: R457 million) mainly due to the building of our new head
office as well as the implementation of the new SAP general ledger, procurement
and human resource system. As the banking union Sasbo plans to strike about retrenchments
in the industry, Capitec said: “We have had no retrenchments and do not plan
any either.” It now employs 13 923 people.

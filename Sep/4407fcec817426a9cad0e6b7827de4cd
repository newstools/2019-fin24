The price of 95 octane petrol will go up by 18 cents a litre, while 93 will cost 4 cent less a litre, the department of energy has confirmed. The price of 95 octane will be R16.21 c/l inland and R15.57 c/l along the coast. The October price adjustments will kick in on Wednesday October 2 and are in line with the expectations of the Automobile Association "The BFP differentials between 95 and 93 petrol grades have changed and therefore the different price adjustments between the two grades," the department said in a statement issued late on Saturday night. Diesel will increase by 25 cents per litre. Illuminating paraffin will be increasing by 25 cents per litre wholesale. The single maximum national retail price for illuminating paraffin will increase by 33 cents per litre. The department said international product prices for petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin increased during the period under review. The rand appreciated against the US dollar during the period under review, on average, when compared to the previous period. The average Rand/US exchange rate for the period 30 August 2019 to 26 September 2019 was R14.8432 compared to R15.1729 during the previous period. "This led to a lower contribution to the basic fuel prices on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 16.02c/l, 17.03 c/l and 17.22 c/l respectively," the department said. - Compiled by Adiel Ismail

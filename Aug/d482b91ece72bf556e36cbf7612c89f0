The state should be at the centre of the development of the country and should take a more entrepreneurial role, said President Cyril Ramaphosa. The president was giving oral replies to questions from members of Parliament on Thursday. Economic Freedom Fighters MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi had asked the president if a new macro-economic framework is needed in the country, where the state plays a central role in development, given that the country is failing to meet the targets of the National Development Plan (NDP). Ramaphosa responded by defending the NDP and describing it as a lodestar for the vision of the country. He acknowledged that SA is trailing on the NDP targets and said he welcomed discussions on what can be done to drive development in the country. He agreed with Ndlozi that the state should play a leading role and drive investment in the country. "We need to be a smart state, entrepreneurial and take risks. Where the private sector does not take risks, the state must be able to take risks," Ramaphosa said. He used an example of how in the US, the government spearheaded the development of Silicon Valley and the military led to the creation of the internet. Ramaphosa said the state must work with the private sector and lead the private sector to invest more in the country. There must be a symbiotic relationship between the government and the private sector, he added.

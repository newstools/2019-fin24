Australia will establish a mechanism for internet providers
to quickly and effectively block websites hosting terror attacks in the wake of
the Christchurch shooting, according to an emailed statement. The government is also creating a center to rapidly detect
and shut down the sharing and live-streaming of the violent material as an
attack takes place, according to the statement. They are recommendations from an industry and government
body established after a man in March live-streamed the killing of more than 40
people in two Christchurch mosques. "The shocking events that took place in Christchurch
demonstrated how digital platforms and websites can be exploited to host
extreme violent and terrorist content," Prime Minister Scott Morrison said
in the statement. "That type of abhorrent material has no place in
Australia and we are doing everything we can to deny terrorists the opportunity
to glorify their crimes, including taking action locally and globally."

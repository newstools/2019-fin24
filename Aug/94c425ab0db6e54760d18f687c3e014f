The JSE closed weaker on Monday as global
markets were stuck in a whirlwind on the back of Donald Trump’s threats to slap
more tariffs on Chinese goods into the USA. In retaliation, on Friday China also
threatened to impose further tariffs on about $US75 billion worth of goods
sending jitters all over global markets. In a turn of events on Monday, Donald Trump
seemed to change his stance on his Friday’s comments as he stated that
prospects for a deal with China were more than likely to happen now compared to
when talks began. Asian markets never got a chance to recover
as Donald Trump u-turned on his Friday comments after their closure. The Japanese Nikkei caught tumbled 2.17%,

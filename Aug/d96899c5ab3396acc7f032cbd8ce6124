The South African Revenue Service has released a joint statement with its chief officer of governance, international relations strategy and communications, Hlengani Mathebula, stating that the latter will no longer be working for the tax agency. This comes after SARS commissioner Edward Kieswetter placed Mathebula and two other executives at the revenue service on precautionary suspension earlier this month. The other two executives were Teboho Mokoena, Chief Officer: Human Capital & Development andÂ Luther Lebelo, Group Executive: Employee Relations. The report which emanated from the Nugent Commission of inquiry into SARS notes that Mathebula was among those who came into high office at the tax body after its institutional memory was hollowed out under former Commissioner Tom Moyane. The joint statement said Mathebula had "interactions and information exchange" with SARS, which persuaded the parties to agree that his "employment relationship" with the revenue service should be brought to an end. "SARS wishes Mr Mathebula well in respect of his future endeavours. Mr Mathebula remains committed to making a contribution towards the Republic of South Africa, in whatever future capacities he may hold," the statement said. The statement added that Mathebula wished SARS well in "fulfilling its mandate for the benefit of the people of South Africa". SARS could not immediately be reached for further comment on the the agreement.

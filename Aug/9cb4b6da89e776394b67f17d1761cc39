A witness who testified at the commission of inquiry into state capture about a fraudulent contract involving SA Express has fled South Africa, saying she fears for her safety. The commission heard on Wednesday morning that Babadi Tlatsana, director of Koroneka Trading and Projects, was in an undisclosed location. Her lawyer does not know where she is. The inquiry heard in mid-June that Tlatsana's company was awarded a R51m contract with the airline to handle ground services at the Mahikeng and Pilanesberg airports without following due procurement process.  Evidence leader advocate Kate Hofmeyr, quoting from an affidavit from Tlatsana's lawyer on Wednesday, said she fled the republic following threats and intimidation in the wake of her testimony. "Suspicious" people were noticed around her house in Mahikeng, unknown men approached family members asking about her whereabouts, and an attempt was made to enter her house, according to the affidavit. "When the commission received this information it took it very seriously," said Hofmeyr. "We have engaged our own investigators, particularly on aspects of security, and they are updating us regularly on this - as recently as yesterday [Wednesday]." "But as matters currently stand, it does appear that Mrs Tlatsana is not within the republic. As we have it from her lawyer, this is the explanation she, at least, gave him". According to Hofmeyr, Tlatsana's lawyer said she has appointed an auditor to write up an overview of Koreneka's finances for the commission. Since August 2018, the inquiry has been investigating allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud at state entities. The chair of the commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, said authorities seem to have done nothing after Tlatsana approached them saying she felt threatened. "I would like to be updated in regard to the matter," he said. * More to come

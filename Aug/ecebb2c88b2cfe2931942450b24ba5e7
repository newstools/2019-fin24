The JSE rose along with European and US
equities after Chinese officials indicated that China was not going to
retaliate immediately to the recent US tariff increase. This helped spur stocks as investors sort after
riskier assets on the back of this reassurance. However, skepticism remains rife given how
easily circumstances can change with a single comment from either China or the
USA. Positive GDP growth out of the USA also
aided in reassuring market participants that the US economy was still strong
despite the risks associated with trade war. On the currency market, the US dollar held
firm against a basket of major currencies. Emerging market currencies also held
their own as they tracked mostly firmer on the day. The rand managed to strengthen to a session
high of R15.25/$ before it retraced to be recorded trading 0.45% firmer at R15.32/$
at 17:00. There was positive news in terms of local
economic data as Statistics SA released South Africa’s producer inflation data
for the month of July. PPI YoY slowed to 4.9% from a prior
recording of 5.8%, which also beat the forecasted level of 5.2%. PPI MoM was
recorded at -0.2% compared to a prior recording of 0.4%. On the local bourse a couple of retailers
released their earnings results which did not come as a surprise given
indications from recent trading statements. The strength in the retailers in today’s
session can mainly be attributed to a firmer rand as well as the market having
priced-in the bulk of today’s results. Massmart [JSE:MSM] which released its
half-year results closed 7.86% firmer at R42.69, Woolworths [JSE:WHL] which
released its full-year results rose 4.55% to close at R54.42, while Mr Price
[JSE:MRP] also advanced as it gained 2.41% to close at R166.60. Sibanye Stillwater [JSE:SGL] released its
half-year results which highlighted that they are expecting an improved outlook
for the remaining half of the year. The stock closed 2.81% firmer at R21.59.

The JSE had another tough session as it
closed weaker on Friday as sentiment remained mostly bearish across all the
major sectors. The local bourse shrugged off gains in Asia
where the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.72%, the Hang Seng rose 0.5% while
the Nikkei gained 0.4%. In Europe, indices tracked mostly lower with the
exception of the FTSE 100 which advanced on the day. In the USA, stocks
retracted in reaction to China’s plans to impose tariffs on certain US goods.
Locally, market participants are still being warded off stocks on the back of
the current weak sentiment characterizing local retailers. On the currency market, the rand made

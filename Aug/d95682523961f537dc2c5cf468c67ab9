Please Call me inventor Nkosana Makate has taken Vodacom to court again, saying he deserves more than the R47m he was offered for his idea. But based on a recent Fin24 poll, most readers think that's more than enough. The ongoing saga between Makate and Vodacom has taken almost a decade to resolve.  More than 20 000 readers participated in the Fin24 poll. Of these, more than half of those who participated voted that the amount Vodacom had offered Makate was "more than enough", 23% said he should "cut his losses and accept the money", 17% said this was "another example of a big corporate taking advantage of the little guy" while the remainder said Makate should continue to fight for more money as the idea was his. It is Makate's case that he is in fact owed more than R10bn. In 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled that Vodacom compensate Makate and that, should there be no agreement, Vodacom group CEO Shameel Joosub break the deadlock. The matter is now due to be heard before court yet again Fin24 previously reported that according to court papers filed August 8, Makate revealed for the first time that Joosub had offered him R47m in October 2018. This was previously part of a confidentiality clause between Makate and the network operator.

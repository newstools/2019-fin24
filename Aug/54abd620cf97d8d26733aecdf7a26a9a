Youth-owned businesses in the agricultural sector are invited to apply for SAB KickStart's Urban Agriculture programme. Now in its second year, the Urban Agriculture programme looks to invest in high potential farming businesses by integrating technology solutions that will grow the businesses and create lasting employment.  It is a 15-month business development programme. It provides successful participants with technical and operational training, hydroponic infrastructure investment, industry-based mentorship, as well as market access. "As a 97% homegrown organisation, farming is key to our business. To strengthen the market and ultimately create jobs outside of our core business, we want to attract young people to agriculture, through technology," says Phumzile Chifunyise, enterprise development manager of SAB and AB InBev Africa. Hydroponic systems are an advanced farming methodology that is of high intensity, that is water and high nutrition based in which the planting is not dependent on soil. "By introducing young farmers to this advanced process, we are looking to grow and bring a young face to agriculture, while rapidly increasing their output." The programme is open to entrepreneurs aged 18 to 35, with a minimum of one-year farming experience. The farm space should be in the region of 1 500m² that is currently used to produce plant-based produce or crop on a revenue generating basis, with potential to scale. Apply here before Sunday, September 1, 2019.

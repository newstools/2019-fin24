Telkom announced on Wednesday that 96% of its fixed line customers got improved communication technology services after they were upgraded to wireless prepaid service. The company said it was ready to discontinue copper-based fixed line prepaid services from the beginning of August. Wireless communication technology is superior to copper-based technology in that it has less interruptions and functions optimally regardless of weather conditions. The Telkom statement the wireless service was gaining momentum with customers, judging from the response to offerings such as SmartVoice, SmartBroadband Wireless and UNLIMITEDhome* fibre. "Having successfully migrated over 96% of prepaid fixed line customers, Telkom is now migrating postpaid fixed copper-based voice and DSL customers to fibre and wireless," the Telkom statement said. Telkom said it would work to have as little interruption to the service during the decommissioning of copper-based connection, but urged customers experiencing problems to report them on their hotline.

Unionised workers in the glass sector will down their tools
on Monday, says the General Industries Workers Union of SA. The union, which is an affiliate of the South African
Federation of Trade Unions, on Sunday evening issued a statement indicating
that close to 1 000 workers will be striking at glass companies including Nampak
Glass, Consol Glass and PG Glass, among others. Workers are demanding an 8.5% increase across the board. Further,
the union wants labour brokers' workers to be made permanent after three months
by client companies. The agreement must be in effect for one year and must
cover all union members, the statement read. According to the union, the employers' association is
offering a 6.75% increase and want a two-year agreement. "Our members have taken the route of strike action
because their living standards and that of workers at large are constantly
being eroded by the unceasing increases in the costs of livingâ€¦ The strike is
therefore a means of defending and protecting workers' current living standards,"
the statement read.

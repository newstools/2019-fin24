Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe's legal troubles have just begun, according to a statement by union Solidarity. The union said in a statement on Monday that it would announce further legal action which it planned to take against Molefe. Solidarity is set to unpack the details of the legal action, at a briefing in Pretoria on Tuesday at noon. Solidarity chief operations officer Dirk Hermann said in the statement the union’s planned legal action would be revealed by Advocate Gerrie Nel and Solidarity on Tuesday. It could involve the seizure of Molefe's assets. Contacted by Fin24 on Monday morning, Molefe said he could not comment on Solidarity's plans for private prosecution as there was no criminal offence mentioned to justify a private prosecution. This development comes after the Constitutional Court dismissed Molefe's leave to appeal against the high court decision which ruled that he must pay back part of the R30m pension he received from the power utility. According to Solidarity, these steps follow due to the National Prosecuting Authority's lack to begin with prosecution, following the criminal complaint the union lodged against Molefe. "Through this action against Molefe, Solidarity wants to contribute to a culture of accountability in South Africa. We cannot allow tax looters to simply get away," said Hermann. The statement said Solidarity was immediately taking steps to recover the cost order and to ensure the recovery of R10m, which Molefe received from the Eskom Pension and Provident Fund.

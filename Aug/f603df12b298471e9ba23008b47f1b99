Hong Kong stocks fell again on Tuesday, extending the previous day's sharp sell-off as an Asia-wide rally on fresh trade hopes was offset by ongoing worries about the impact of violent protests in the city. The Hang Seng Index fell 0.06% to 25 664.07. But the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index added 1.35% to 2 902.19, while the Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, climbed 1.87% to 1 595.82.

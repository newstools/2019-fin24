Comair board chair Pieter van Hoven is set to retire, the airline announced in a notice to shareholders on Monday. Comair operates under its low-fare airline brand, kulula.com, as well as under the British Airways livery, as part of a license agreement. Van Hoven has served as chairperson for about eight years, Comair said. His retirement will come into effect after the company's annual general meeting to be held on Tuesday October 29. He will continue to serve on the board as an independent executive director, the notice read. The board will make an announcement on the new chairperson in the next few weeks. The announcement comes after joint-CEOs Glenn Orsmond and Wrenelle Stander took over the reins from former CEO Erik Venter in July 2019.

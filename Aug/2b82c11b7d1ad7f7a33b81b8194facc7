Tokyo stocks opened higher on Friday, following rises on Wall Street, as data showed the world's third-biggest economy was growing faster than analysts had expected. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.68% to 20 733.46 in early trade while the broader Topix index was up 0.63% at 1 508.13. "US stocks rose sharply, providing relief and support to the Tokyo market," said Makoto Sengoku, market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute. The stronger-than-expected GDP data also helped boost the market, he said. "The reading of the data itself was not a huge buying peg... but nonetheless it confirmed personal spending could pick up," he said. Official data showed gross domestic product (GDP) in the world's third-biggest economy grew 0.4% from the previous quarter on robust consumer demand, beating analysts' median forecast of 0.1%. Japan had an unprecedented string of 10 holidays around the May 1 enthronement of the new emperor, igniting travel and other leisure demand.

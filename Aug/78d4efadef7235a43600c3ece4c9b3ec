Global stocks including those on the JSE plummeted on Monday
as the Chinese currency fell to a three-year low against the greenback. Speculation remains rife that this is a counter measure to
the additional tariffs that were imposed by Donald Trump on $300bn worth of
Chinese imports. Emerging market currencies and stocks sank on the back of this
development, while Treasury bond yields rose as investors fled to safe-haven
assets. Earlier in Asian markets trading, the Hang Seng took a heavy
knock as it fell 2.85% while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.91%. In Japan
the Nikkei fell 1.74%. Most of the major indices in Europe weakened by more
than 1.5% on the day while significant losses were also recorded at the open of
US equity markets. The rand had another weak trading session as it narrowly
came within breach of R15/$ as it peaked at a session high of R14.95/$. The

on the back of weaker earnings, started this trading week on the backfoot as it
fell 6.79% to end the day at R7.14. Index heavyweight Naspers [JSE:NPN] also
came under significant pressure after its Hang Seng listed Tencent Holdings closed
4.27% lower on Monday. This resulted in Naspers falling 4.58% to end the day at
R3350.00. Aspen Pharmacare [JSE:APN] lost further ground as it slipped
5.41% to close at R84.08, while KAP Industrial Holdings [JSE:KAP] lost 6.35% to

trade war, brent crude slipped further in todayâ€™s session. It was recorded
trading 2.26% weaker at $60.49/barrel just after the JSE close. *Musa Makoni is a trading specialist at Purple Group

Eurozone stock markets recovered at the start of trading on Friday, but the opening of London's benchmark FTSE 100 index was delayed owing to a "trading" issue according to its operator. In the eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX 30 climbed 0.5% to 11 471.02 points and the Paris CAC 40 won 0.4% to 5 258.88 compared with Thursday's closing levels. The London Stock Exchange Group meanwhile said it was "investigating a potential trading services issue" that prevented the FTSE 100 and second-tier FTSE 250 indices from opening. World stock markets have endured another volatile week as US-China trade talk hopes fade and following economic data that pointed to a possible global recession.

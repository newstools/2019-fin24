South Africa’s Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union is making “slow, steady” progress on wage talks, but the offer from the former Lonmin operations was provoking a strike, its president said. Sibanye’s former Lonmin operations made the lowest offer with annual increases of R300, R350 and R400 over three years, AMCU President Joseph Mathunjwa told reporters in Johannesburg on Tuesday. “It is an insult to workers and we believe Sibanye is trying to provoke us into a strike,” Mathunjwa said. The Lonmin merger was politically motivated against the union, he said.

Tokyo, Aug 20, 2019 (AFP) -Tokyo stocks closed higher for a third straight session on Tuesday, taking a positive lead from bullish trade on Wall Street. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index moved up 0.55 percent, or 114.06 points, to end at 20,677.22, while the broader Topix index climbed 0.83 percent, or 12.44 points, to 1,506.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.0 percent Monday, joining a global rally amid talk of economic stimulus in Germany and China and expectation of further Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. "US and European equities had a solid night boosted by confirmation the US commerce department will delay its ban on (Chinese telecom giant) Huawei for another 90 days," said Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank. "Equity markets were also boosted by further speculation that the German government is preparing to ease fiscal policy with the news also fuelling a rise in core global bond yields." "The Nikkei index rose following gains of US shares... but the growth was rather limited as traders are closely watching US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech" when he opens the central bank's annual Jackson Hole symposium later this week, Yoshihiro Ito, Okasan Online Securities chief strategist, said in a note.

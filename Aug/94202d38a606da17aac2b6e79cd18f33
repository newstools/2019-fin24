South Africa recorded a R2.88bn trade deficit deficit for July, after recording a revised surplus of R5.4bn in June, the South African Revenue Service said in a statement on Friday. A trade deficit shows that South Africa's imports exceeded the value of its exports. The consensus expectation was for a surplus of R2.9 billion, said Investec economist Lara Hodes in a note to clients. The R2.88 billion trade deficit for July 2019 is attributable to exports of R112.94 billion
and imports of R115.82 billion.   Exports from June to July 2019 increased by R3.74bn (3.4%), while imports in the same period went up 11.7% to R12.17bn. The statistics include trade data with Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia (BELN). Vehicle and transport equipment topped export products, followed by vegetable and chemical products. SARS said the year-to-date trade deficit of R4.35bn was a deterioration from the R3.81bn deficit for the comparable period in 2018. The overall year-on-year deficit comes as the country battles an economic slump, which has hit business confidence leading to downward growth forecasts.

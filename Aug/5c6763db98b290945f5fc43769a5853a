Global stocks including the JSE weakened on Wednesday as mounting signals of a global economic slowdown surfaced. With demand for sovereign bonds souring on safe-haven buying, the US 2-year and 10-year Treasury bond yields inverted for the first time since 2007. This is significant as most recessions in the US have been preceded by such an inversion. An inversion is a phenomena where shorter dated yields are higher than longer dated yields. This inversion combined with a contraction in German GDP of 0.1% in the last quarter saw European stocks plummet on Wednesday, while US stocks quickly erased their prior session’s gains at the open. Locally, Statistics SA released South Africa’s retail sales data for the month of June as they expanded 2.4% year-on-year which is higher than the prior recording of 2.3%, while retail sales month-on-month advanced 0.3% from a prior recording of 0.1%.

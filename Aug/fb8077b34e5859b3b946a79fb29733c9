Wall Street stocks opened higher on Thursday following mixed US economic data, bouncing modestly after the Dow suffered its worst session of the year. About five minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 25 531.36, up 0.2%. The broad-based S&P 500 also added 0.2% at 2 846.22, along with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index, which stood at 2 846.22. Major US indices lost about 3% on Wednesday after a key US bond benchmark raised recession worries amid mushrooming fears of a global slowdown due in part to the US-China trade war.

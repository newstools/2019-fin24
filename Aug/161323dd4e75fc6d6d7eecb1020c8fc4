The JSE
financial 15 index has been battered in recent weeks, by a combination
of a very weak local economy, as well as a very weak rand. Its chart is showing
more downside to come unfortunately, before it finally bottoms. JSE FINANCIAL 15 INDEX – Downtrend not over yet Recommendation: Sell short (again) after a rally. Current Trend: Short
and med-term down. Long-term sideways. Strategy:
Sell short fini stocks after a rally to 15 100 level. Chart Setup: The financial 15 index is on its way down to 14 280, based on a breakdown of a large wedge (lines 2 and 3). It’s currently giving a relief rally (bounce), and then one more drop to come after this. • Its short-term Stochastic is oversold, which is still fairly bullish in the immediate short-term. • Elliot Wave analysis (labelled as roman numbers) shows the current bounce as a Wave-IV and points to one more drop (after the rally), to complete a Wave-V.  (There are five waves in an Elliot Wave sequence in the direction of the trend). (Daily chart)  Strategy Details: Traders look to sell short large-cap financial
stocks on a bounce to 15 100 on this index. (I’d like to see a reversal
day down in that area to enter short). Target: A bounce to 15 100 level (or a bit higher), and then
one final drop.  Line 1 support is at 14 000,
which is a realistic downside target. Stop-loss: For shorting after a rally, the stop is a close above
15 500 Tighten it a lot as it nears line 1 (14 000). Disclaimer: Fin24 cannot be held liable for any investment decisions made based on the advice given by independent financial service providers.

Tongaat Hulett's listed unit in Zimbabwe has delayed its financials
for the second time after missing the July 31 extended deadline, saying it was
now finalising complex accounting issues stemming from its JSE-listed parent
company's re-statement of financials. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed Hippo Valley had asked
for an extension of the June 30 deadline to release its financials. However, it
failed to meet the July 31 extended deadline and has applied to the ZSE to be
allowed a second extension to August 14. Tongaat also owns non-listed Triangle Sugar Corporation in
Zimbabwe. Bigboy Shava, company secretary for Hippo Valley, said in a
notice to shareholders in the company on Thursday that "preparation of the
financial results is in the finalisation stage". This extended delay had been prompted by "financial
reviews that were taking place" at Tongaat Hulett and which had disrupted
the timely release of financials for the year to March 31 2019. Further explanation from the company is that "given the
complexity of the issues involved," the company now requires more time to
finalise the already delayed financials. Hippo Valley consequently lodged an application for a second
extension to the deadline for the release of its financials with the ZSE. "A request has been made to the ZSE who have granted
the company a final extension and as such, the companyâ€™s abridged audited
financial results will now be published on or before 14 August 2019,"
added Shava. The Hippo Valley parent company has been in a pickle over
the financial re-statement which has prompted it to restructure its operations.
The restructuring is expected to also affect its operations outside South
Africa, including Zimbabwe, amid fears of job losses as the cost structure is
re-evaluated. Prior to the accounting crisis, Hippo Valley had said it was
expecting to produce about 500 000 tonnes of sugar. An additional expansion
project was expected to add up a further 50 000 tonnes of the sweet commodity.

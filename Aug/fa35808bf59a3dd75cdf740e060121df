Global stocks surged on Thursday as trade war fears eased
following the better than expected strengthening of the Chinese currency. The Chinese yuan fell to a three-year low earlier in the week which
most market participants saw as a reactionary move to the increase in tariffs
by the US. This resulted in the US National Treasury classifying China
as a currency manipulator, which sent global stocks tumbling lower. Volatility
has been high in this week’s trading, and investors remain jittery over the
possibility of another escalation which can easily be reignited. Another volatile trading session ensued for the rand which
fell to a session low of $15.20/$ after having peaked at a session high of R14.96/$
in earlier trading. The rand traded mostly weaker on the day before it was
recorded trading 0.11% softer at R15.06/$ at 17:00. Blue-chip counters surged on the day with index heavyweight
Naspers [JSE:NPN] climbing 2.37% to end the day at R3449.99. Mining giant BHP
Group [JSE:BHP] gained 2.91% to close at R331.83, while its sector peer Anglo
American [JSE:AGL] managed to gain 2.9% to close at R339.05. Most of the
general miners rebounded on the day which saw gains being recorded for Glencore
[JSE:GLN] which gained 4.91% to close at R43.16, Exxaro Resources [JSE:EXX]
which added 1.84% to close at R147.24, and Kumba Iron Ore [JSE:KIO] which
advanced 5.23% to end the day at R431.07. Other significant gains on the day were recorded for Mondi [JSE:MNP] which advanced 2.06% to close at R289.72, and Capitec Bank
Holdings [JSE:CPI] which closed at R1107.00 after gaining 0.64%. City Lodge Hotels [JSE:CLH] slumped in today’s session
following the release of its full-year trading statement in which the company
indicated that it is expecting a decline in earnings. The stock eventually
closed 8.22% lower at R99.58. AngloGold Ashanti [JSE:ANG] came under pressure
following the release of a relatively mixed set of half-year results. The stock
closed 5.48% lower at R302.48. Discovery [JSE:DSY] fell dramatically in the
afternoon session as it eventually closed the day 8.5% lower at R115.47. Gold Fields [JSE:GFI]

saw the stock drop 3.29% to close at R87.86. Other significant losses recorded
on the day were for MTN Group [JSE:MTN] which lost 2.87% to close at R109.47,

broader JSE All-Share index added 0.74%. The financials index was the only
major index to close softer as it lost 0.88%. The industrials and resources

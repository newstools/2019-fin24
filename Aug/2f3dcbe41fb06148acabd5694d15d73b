The JSE closed off a difficult trading week on Friday, ending the day flat as sentiment remained mostly bearish for local stocks. The trend on the JSE was in contrast to other global indices which tracked mostly higher in what could be termed a relief bounce given how much they have fallen this week. This relief could be temporary given that the fundamentals which caused the downtrend this week are still in play. Investors will continue to look for fresh clues on the trade war, and they will also be keeping a close eye on the US 2-year and 10-year Treasury bond yield spread. On the JSE, Sasol [JSE:SOL] tumbled after the open following the release of a statement indicating that they were going to delay the release of their financial results to the 19th of September.

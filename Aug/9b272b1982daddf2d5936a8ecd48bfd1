President Cyril
Ramaphosa on Friday announced that Mondo Mazwai would become the first black
South African or woman to head the Competition Tribunal as of this past Thursday. The Competition Tribunal
is an independent adjudicative body
established in terms of the Competition Act of 1998. The tribunal holds hearings which are open to the
public. In almost all cases, apart from a few procedural type cases, three
Tribunal members must hear a case and make a decision. According to a
statement from the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, Mazwai holds
an LLB from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and previously served as National
Head of Competition at Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyer before joining the Tribunal in 2013. She takes over
from Norman Manoim, who served as a Member of the Tribunal for 20 years and as
chair for the last ten years. Ramaphosa also re-appointed three Competition
Tribunal members at the recommendation of the Minister of Trade and Industry,
Mr Ebrahim Patel. According to the
statement, in the last five years, penalties imposed by the Tribunal for
anti-competitive conduct has totaled R2.8bn, and has resulted in the break-up
of cartels in construction, automotive components and media. The reappointed
members are Yasmin Carrim, Andreas Wessels and Andiswa Ndoni. They have a combined
35 years of experience at the tribunal between them. Minister of Trade,
Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel said in the department statement that
the outgoing Manoim had a solid track record with the tribunal. "Norman was part
of the team which drafted the original Competition Act, and was a thoughtful
advisor to me last year as I considered a number of changes to the Act, in the
most significant revision of our competition law over the past two decades," said Patel.

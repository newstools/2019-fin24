For
the first time since United States President Donald Trump was elected, more Americans say the
economy is getting worse than getting better. A new Quinnipiac Poll shows
37% saying the economy is declining, compared with 31% who continue to see
improvement. Only 30% say the economy is staying about the same, the lowest
number on record. Polls have consistently shown the
economy to be Trump’s strongest suit, but the Quinnipiac poll could be a
turning point. Not only are people less optimistic, but they’re blaming Trump:
For the first time, more Americans say his policies are doing more harm than
good, 41% to 37%. "As trade tensions with China
dominate the headlines, confidence in the economy is slipping," said Quinnipiac
pollster Mary Snow. Trump: Won't lose US wealth to dreams, windmills President Donald Trump dismissed concerns about climate change at the G7 summit in France Monday, saying he's "not going to lose" America's wealth "on dreams" and "windmills." He skipped a session on the topic earlier in the day. "And roughly four in 10 voters blame the president’s
policies, saying they are hurting the economy, the highest level since Trump
took office". The decline in economic
expectations may also be a function of just how high-flying the perception of
the economy still is: 61% say the economy is excellent or good, down from a
high-water mark of 71% in May; 37% say it’s poor or not so good. Still, the poll
confirms other data points, like declining consumer confidence among Republicans and independents, suggesting that Trump's fate
may be tied to the economic outlook in 2020. Quinnipiac University
surveyed 1422 registered voters nationwide from 21 to 26 August, with a margin
of error of 3.1 percentage points.

The US government has announced that an increase in the investment threshold for foreigners to access a US Green Card via the Immigrant Investor EB-5 Programme will come into effect from November 21, 2019, when the amount will increase from $500 000 (about R7.5m) to $900 000 (about R13.5m). The EB-5 programme provides the opportunity to acquire US citizenship via investment in a commercial property venture – with the key advantage that the investment capital returns to the investor after a period of five years. According to Chris Immelman, who heads up Pam Golding International, while still significant, the increase is not as high as was anticipated. "So, if you are serious about applying for a Green Card through the EB-5 Programme and want to benefit from the lower investment of $500 000, we strongly advise that you aim to submit your application by November 1, just to be on the safe side," says Immelman. Pam Golding International has teamed up with American Dream to offer access to the EB-5 Programme. A US Green Card is valid for 10 years. Immelman says it usually takes 18-24 months from the time of your investment to obtain your US Green Card, with citizenship after five years. Immelman says It is important that applicants deal with a reputable developer who will ensure that the commercial property development is properly built and that the investor can be sure that the full amount – which is currently $500 000 - will be returned upon completion.

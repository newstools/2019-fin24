The African National Congress has already lost the e-toll
battle, and is ignoring "volumes" of evidence that it has failed, the
Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse has said. OUTA was responding to ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule,
who on Tuesday briefed media on the governing party's latest National Executive
Committee meeting. Magashule said the ANC had reaffirmed the user-pays
principle for financing the upgrading of roads. In a statement, OUTA said it estimated that as many as four
in five Gauteng motorists were ignoring their unpaid e-toll bills. "It is clear to us that the ANC NEC is ignoring volumes
of empirical evidence from almost six years of the failure of the Gauteng
e-toll scheme," said OUTA chief executive Wayne Duvenage. "Statements, policies and regulations are one thing,
but what matters most is the ability to implement laws and policies and, if government
is unable to do so, it needs to find practical and workable solutions to the
impasse as opposed to making glib statements in the hope that the problems will
disappear." According to Magashule, the NEC was in support of current
processes to deal with e-tolls. "The NEC noted and supported the process
by government to deal with the matter of e-tolls so that it is resolved
amicably and expeditiously. The NEC re-affirms the user-pay principle in
dealing with the financing of major infrastructure," he said. E-tolls have been a contentious issue in Gauteng. Last month,
Finance Minister Tito Mboweni took
to Twitter to say Â Gauteng e-toll
users must pay, while the Gauteng provincial legislature stood by its position
that there was no future for the e-toll system.

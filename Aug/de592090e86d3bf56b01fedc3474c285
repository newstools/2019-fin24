The JSE got off to a firmer start this week
as it tracked other global stocks higher, after the USA signaled progress in
the trade talks with China. Concerns about a recession took a backseat
as investors sort after riskier assets on the back of this positive news. In
Hong Kong the Hang Seng surged 2.17% while in mainland China the Shanghai
Composite Index also gained 2.17%. In Japan, the Nikkei gained 0.71%. Counters
in Europe all tracked higher while in the USA all the major indices rallied by
more than 1% after the open. On the currency market, the rand slipped
against the greenback despite the latter tried mostly flat on the day against a
basket of major currencies. After having peaked at a session high of R15.20/$
earlier, the local currency retreated to a session low of R15.44/$ before it
was recorded trading 0.81% weaker at R15.41/$ at 17.00 CAT. A couple of blue-chips helped propel the
JSE higher on the day. Mining giant Anglo American PLC [JSE:AGL] recorded gains
of 3.07% as it closed at R323.84, while luxury retailer Richemont [JSE:CFR]
gained 2.3% to close at R117.90. Rand hedge Mondi PLC [JSE:MNP] rose 2.48% as
it closed at R290.65, while diversified miner South32 [JSE:S32] managed to add 3.85%
to close at R29.43. Grindrod [JSE:GND] closed as one of the day’s biggest
gainers after it rallied 12.24% to close at R5.50, while Brait [JSE:BAT]
climbed 6.77% to close at R14.04. Oil and gas producer Sasol [JSE:SOL]
continues to claw back from last week’s lows, and in today’s session it managed
to gain another 3.29% to close at R273.71. Discovery Ltd [JSE:DSY] quickly erased most
of Friday’s gains as it fell 8.3% to end the day at R101.47, while
pharmaceutical giant Aspen [JSE:APN] lost 4.96% to close at R65.91. Steinhoff
International [JSE:SNH] reached a new all-time low of R0.97 before it closed
4.81% weaker at R0.99. Blue Label Telecoms [JSE:BLU] came under pressure after
the company released a weaker trading statement for its full financial year,
and it also announced a delay in the release of its financial results. The
stock eventually closed 3.51% weaker at R3.30. Other significant losers on the
day included Bidvest [JSE:BVT] which dropped 2.785 to close at R174.00,
Massmart [JSE:MSM] which fell 1.49% to R44.23, and MTN Group [JSE:MTN] which
closed at R103.55 after dropping 1.39%. The JSE Top-40 index eventually closed
1.11% higher while the broader JSE All-Share index gained 1.02%. All the major
indices advanced in today’s session with the biggest being the Resources index
which rallied 2.11%. The Industrials and Financials indices added 0.96% and
0.22% respectively. At 17.00 CAT, Gold was 0.84% weaker at
$1501.03/Oz, Palladium had rallied 1.97% to trade at $1480.60/Oz, and Platinum
was up 0.9% at $856.45/Oz. Brent crude traded mostly firmer on the day,
and it was recorded trading 1.07% firmer at $59.24/barrel just after the JSE
close.

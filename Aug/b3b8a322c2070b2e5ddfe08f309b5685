The Eskom Pension and Provident Fund has confirmed to Fin24 that its lawyers instructed former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe to return more than R10m he received from the fund, and he may need to pay up as soon as next week. This comes after the Constitutional Court dismissed Molefe's leave to appeal earlier this month against a North Gauteng High Court decision last year that he must pay back around R10m in pension benefits from Eskom. Molefe told Fin24 following the high court judgment and cost order that Solidarity was making "fantastical claims" and that the Pretoria High Court had "made an error". Eskom Pension and Provident Fund spokesperson Thato Motlhabi told Fin24 that it had directed its attorneys to act in line with the ruling of the North Gauteng High Court, confirming that Molefe has less than a week to pay up. "The EPPF have instructed its attorneys to seek to recover the amounts due to the Fund, in compliance with the order of the High Court. A letter of demand has been sent to Mr Molefe, through his attorneys, requesting payment," said Motlhabi. Motlhabi said the details of how Molefe would return the money to the pension fund would be determined in due course. "The high court judgment stipulated that Mr Molefe needed to repay all amounts paid to him by the EPPF, totalling R10 327 074.53, within 10 days (of the ruling). The EPPF is in the process of seeking payment and any payment terms shall be set out in the course of these actions," Motlhabi said. She told Fin24 that the fund would look to recover the amounts due through the appropriate legal remedies. Union Solidarity said in a statement that Molefe's attorneys had told them in a letter that they requested a 30-day postponement for the payment of the R700Â 000 that Molefe owed the union due to a cost order from the court. Fin24 reached out to Molefe, who did not wish to comment.

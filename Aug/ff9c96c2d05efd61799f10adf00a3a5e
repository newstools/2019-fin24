The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa announced on Wednesday evening that its group executive for information technology, Chris Mbhatha, had been found guilty for his role in the illegal awarding of a contract and dismissed. Prasa contracts have been the subject of a number of forensic investigations. The rail agency said Mbhatha was found guilty in the Siyangena Technologies matter, where a contract was found to have been illegally awarded. The contract was for the installation of automatic speed gates, electronic information boards and surveillance systems. "Prasa is currently pursuing Siyangena in an effort to recover the monies paid to it which amount to approximately R4.5bn," the statement said.. Other executives who were also charged on the same matter have been found guilty and dismissed after hearings.

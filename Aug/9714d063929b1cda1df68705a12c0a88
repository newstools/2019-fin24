South Africa's intentions to tap state workers' pension
funds to revive a struggling economy would be strongly opposed, the Sunday
Times reports, citing a major trade group on pensions. The state workers' pension funds lobby group doesn't trust
government investing pension funds to bail out struggling state-owned companies
such as utility Eskom Holdings, said Adamus Stemmet, spokesman for the
Association of Monitoring and Advocacy of Government Pensions. The investments
wouldn't yield positive returns, Stemmet told the weekly. President Cyril Ramaphosa told Parliament on August 22 the
nation must debate the use of prescribed assets to rejuvenate investment and
boost tepid economic growth. Continuing to invest pension funds in the
debt-laden state-owned utility Eskom, for example, would result in further
losses, Stemmet said. "If we could have trusted the government, this might
have been an option," Stemmet said. "But we cannot trust this government;
there would be a negative return on any money invested in Eskom or any other
state-owned enterprise." The Public Investment Corporation, which manages about R2trn
on behalf of state workers, is under pressure to adopt a mandate that includes
economic growth rather than focus purely on financial returns.

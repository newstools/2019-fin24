The South African Broadcasting Corporation took to social
media networking site Twitter on Friday afternoon to announce that Sylvia Tladi
would be the broadcaster's new chief operations officer in an acting capacity. Tladi now takes on the position which was previously assumed
by Hlaudi Motsoeneng, who left the public service broadcaster under a cloud of
manifold accusations of impropriety and maladministration. The tweet did not provide details such as when Tladi's first
day on the job would be or her duration in the position. SABC spokesperson Vuyo
Mthembu confirmed the appointment and said a permanent COO would be found in
due course. "She is appointed with immediate effect. She will oversee
the various operations, including at radio. The SABC is still in the process of seeking out and appointing a
permanent chief operations officer and that process is underway," said Mthembu.

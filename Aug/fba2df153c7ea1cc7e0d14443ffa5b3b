The JSE advanced on Wednesday primarily on
the back of solid gains on the financials index which were bolstered by the
firmer rand. Global sentiment was also improved ahead of
the release of the US Fed’s FOMC meeting minutes from its last policy meeting.
The minutes are scheduled to be released at 20.00 CAT. In the USA, better than
expected earnings numbers from retail giants Target Corp and Lowe’s also helped
lift US equity futures higher, and subsequently we saw the spot market open
firmer as well. Locally, Statistics SA released South
Africa’s inflation data for the month of July. CPI YoY slowed down to 4% from a
prior recording of 4.5%, while CPI MoM was unchanged from the prior recording
of 0.4%. On the back of this data and a relatively flat US currency, the rand
advanced against the greenback as it reached a session high of R15.15/$ before
it retraced to trade 0.77% firmer at R15.23/$ at 17.00 CAT. On the JSE, Steinhoff International

slipped 2.21% to close at R316.16. Intu Properties [JSE:ITU] had a tough outing

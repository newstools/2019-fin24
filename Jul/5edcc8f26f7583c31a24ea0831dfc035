The appointment of Jabu Mabuza as interim executive chair for Eskom and acting CEO of Eskom Holdings was not discussed at the African National Congress' National Executive Committee meeting over the weekend, the ruling party's deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte said during a briefing on Tuesday. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan announced in a statement on Monday afternoon that he had informed the Eskom Annual General Meeting (AGM) of his decision to appoint Mabuza in this manner. Phakamani Hadebe has resigned as Eskom CEO and will leave the state-owned company on Wednesday July 31. Duarte said at the briefing that the announcement of Mabuza's appointment was made after the NEC meeting had already finished. "Of course, it is of concern to us that the same person will chair and be the CEO of Eskom," said Duarte. "We will raise the matter and concern with [Gordhan]." Duarte said that there was, at the same time, an understanding that someone had to be appointed as a matter of urgency, given the fact that Eskom was presenting its results on Tuesday. In his statement regarding Mabuza's appointment, Gordhan said that within the three-month period during which Mabuza would be the executive chair and acting CEO, the Eskom board would conclude the process of identifying a suitable candidate to become the next Eskom group CEO. Hadebe resigned in May. In his resignation letter, he said the "unimaginable demands" of the job were having a negative impact on his health. Cabinet approved Hadebe's appointment as permanent CEO in May 2018, after he had been serving in an acting capacity since January 2018.

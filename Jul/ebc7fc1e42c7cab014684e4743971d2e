The South African Revenue Service (SARS) said in a statement on Monday that it had noted the recent Sunday Times article relating to allegations against SARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter in his role as Chair of the Technology Innovation Agency (TIA). The newspaper reported on Sunday that TIA ex-CEO Barlow Manilal had issued a 22-page complaint about Kieswetter to the minister of higher education, science and technology, Blade Nzimande. Manilal's contract was terminated a year early by the board last month. According to the Sunday paper, Manilal said Kieswetter "bullied and hounded" him during his tenure as chair.Manilal also claimed Kieswetter tried to set up a profitable coaching contract for a friend of his, and that he insisted on flying business class, although this was against the TIA's policy â€“ claiming it was for an unspecified medical condition. In its brief statement on Monday, the tax agency said simply that Kieswetter had responded to the journalist. "The Commissioner has further stated that matters between an employer and an employee are confidential and he continues to respect the relevant process under way with regard to this matter. "Mr. Kieswetter will allow this process to run its course and will abide by the outcome. In the meantime, he continues to focus on the very important role of running SARS," it said.

Saving
money is not just for when you already have a purchase or holiday idea â€“ it
should be something that you do monthly and you need to be disciplined with it,
says venture capitalist and entrepreneur Shakes Motsilili. Motsilili,
who is also a TEDx speaker, also looks to savings wisdom from billionaire Warren Buffet. He once said: "Do not save what is left over after spending but spend what is
left after saving." Motsilili has his own savings wisdom. He shares 10 practical tips: 1. Stick to a budget You
need to ask yourself; do you want it, or do you need it? 2. Grocery shopping management Shop
for specials and buy monthly. One
spends so much more, especially on treats and luxuries when you shop randomly
through the month. 3. Healthier lifestyle Bad
habits are expensive. A box of cigarettes can cost up to R50, and up to R80 in
nightclubs. Stop
smoking, reduce buying junk food and daily alcoholic drinks. 4. Save an amount of your earnings every month Set
up a monthly debit order to your savings account. 5. Invest Start
investing your savings smartly. This
could be as simple as setting up a money market account, which attracts higher
interest than an ordinary bank savings or cheque account. 6. Think about how you travel Whether
you use your own car or public transport, you need to have a look at a more optimal
way to do your daily travels. Buy
monthly tickets for public transport or try joining a carpool. 7. Be very prudent with your entertainment spend Carry
cash when you go out night. When the money is finished you go home. 8. Prepare meals at home Prepare
food at home, or carry a packed lunch and cook food instead of buying
take-aways. Carry
beverages from home. Buy
in bulk at a supermarket. 9. Cancel memberships you don't use If
you aren't going to gym, why are you paying for it? 10. Save for a reason Have
reasons for saving so that it stops being an exercise without real meaning for
you.

Absa has rejected Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's assertion that she subpoenaed the bank to provide bank account information relating to her investigation into President Cyril Ramaphosa. "We wish to place on record that Absa is not aware of such a supboena and therefore has not refused to cooperate with her investigation," said the bank's spokesperson Phumza Macanda in a statement on Friday. "In the past 12 months, Absa has received two subpoenas from the Public Protector and has, in accordance with the law, complied with them. These subpoenas did not involve any information relating to the president. The Public Protector's assertion is therefore refuted." Mkhwebane found earlier on Friday that Ramaphosa had deliberately misled Parliament when he responded to a question about a R500 000 donation to his 2017 ANC presidential campaign in November last year. She also found that his actions were inconsistent with his position as deputy president at the time. Additionally, Mkhwebane said she found that Ramaphosa had breached the Executive Ethics Code by failing to disclose financial interest accrued to him as a result of the donations received for the so-called CR17 campaign.

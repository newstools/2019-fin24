President Cyril Ramaphosa may have found a solution for world leaders tired of travelling to unfriendly provinces or dull conferences. Send your hologram. On Friday, the president spoke at a Digital Economy Summit in Midrand, a northern suburb of Johannesburg. Meantime, his holographic likeness delivered his remarks from a lectern at the Rustenburg Civic Centre, about 80 miles northwest of the city. The presidentâ€™s office said in a statement that the first-of-its-kind presentation showcases "the advancements in technology and immense opportunities of the digital economy".Now, if only holograms could shake hands on the campaign trail.

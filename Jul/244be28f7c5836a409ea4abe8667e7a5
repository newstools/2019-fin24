The judicial commission of inquiry into state asset manager the Public Investment Corporation has cancelled its hearing for the rest of the week due to protests in Tshwane. Municipal workers are protesting for higher pay, causing disruptions to traffic. On Tuesday morning the commission said it would recommence on August 12. Chaired by Judge Lex Mpati, it is investigating allegations of wrongdoing at the PIC, which manages R2.2trn on behalf of public servants. It was on Tuesday set to hear further testimony from the PIC's former head, Dan Matjila, about investments in AYO Technology Solutions and related matters. In a statement in the government gazette on Friday, meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa granted the commission an extension to submit its final report by October 31.

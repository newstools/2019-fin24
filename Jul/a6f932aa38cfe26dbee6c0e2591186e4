Kganyago will serve another five years, effective from November 9, 2019. His current term ends on November 8. Fundi Tshazibana and Rashad Cassim have been appointed as deputies. Tshazibana is currently the Adviser to the Governors of the SARB. She was appointed as adviser in January 2018, though the appointment became effective in February this year, making her the seventh member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). She has worked at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the National Treasury, and the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa), and holds a Master's degree in economics.

Cassim has been an outspoken critic of proposed nationalisation of the Reserve Bank. Mboweni said of the appointments: "We congratulate the appointees and look forward to working with them. We need not remind them of the tough economic and fiscal circumstances facing South Africa at the current moment. "They have my full support and confidence that they will take South Africa forward as we move to bring development to our people."

It’s official. MacKenzie and Jeff Bezos are divorced after
25 years of marriage. A King County, Washington judge on Friday signed an order
formalising the separation. That sets the stage for the transfer of some 19.7
million shares of Amazon.com Inc. to MacKenzie’s name. The Bezoses announced
the split in January. That 4% holding is valued at $38.3bn (about R540bn), enough
to place her 22nd on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world’s
500 richest people. Her former husband, the founder and chief executive officer
of the world’s largest online retailer and web-services company, retains a 12%
stake worth $114.8bn (about R1.6 trn) and remains the world’s wealthiest
person. The court papers formalising the divorce revealed little
else about the terms of the separation. The couple filed a parenting plan for
their children earlier this week. MacKenzie Bezos, a 49-year-old novelist, said
in an April tweet that she gave Jeff Bezos, 55, all of her interests in the
Washington Post and space-exploration company Blue Origin. She also signed the Giving Pledge in May, promising to
donate more than half of her fortune to philanthropy.

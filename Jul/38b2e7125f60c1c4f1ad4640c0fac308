Cathay Pacific will re-introduce its seasonal non-stop flight between Cape Town and Hong Kong, starting in November 2019 and ending in February 2020. This is following the positive response received from passengers in both cities last year.  According to Ashish Kapur, Cathay Pacific country manager for South Africa and Indian Ocean, last year's introduction of the Cape Town to Hong Kong service was well-received by business and leisure passengers alike.,” says Kapur. In his view, with the route re-opening in November, it will continue to help increase tourism and investment between the two cities.” Kapur says that, with business travel to Cape Town constantly on the rise, the service fills the gap in the market for passengers travelling for business from Hong Kong and other parts of Asia. The early morning arrival time in Hong Kong is an added benefit for business travellers who can easily arrive on the day of a meeting and conference.            Cargo is an important business vertical of Cathay Pacific. With this new service, on the Airbus A350-900, there will be additional cargo space available. It will also expand opportunities for trade between Asia and South Africa as well as sustain key exports such as wine and seafood between the two regions. “The Cape Town Air Access partnership is extremely excited by this announcement, and the boost it will provide for the Western Cape economy," said Wesgro CEO Tim Harris. "The seasonal Hong Kong route has not only connected two popular cities, but it has also affected positive growth. Compared to the same period in 2017/18, the seasonal Hong Kong 2018/19 route saw a 10% increase in two-way passengers between the Western Cape and greater Asian market. This means increased business and tourism, and a positive benefit to our local economy" concluded Harris. The route includes three flights a week with a flight duration of 13 hours 50 minutes.

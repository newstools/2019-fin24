The JSE fell sharply on Tuesday as it tracked other major global indices which have primarily weakened on the back of reduced demand for riskier assets since the release of US jobs data on Friday. The local bourse quickly erased the meagre gains from the prior session on Monday. The index’s mining giants dragged the resources index lower despite some minor gains for some gold miners, while the financials index came under pressure as the rand recorded another volatile session. The rand managed to peak at a session high of R14.14/$ --but the gains were short-lived as it fell to a session low of R14.26/$.

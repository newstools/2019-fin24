The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants
announced on Thursday through a statement that it had suspended former
Steinhoff International CEO, pending the finalisation of disciplinary
proceedings against him. The statement confirmed that Jooste's lawyers gave the
accountants’ body his resignation letter last week. The statement said the board of SAICA resolved not to
accept Jooste’s resignation and to suspend his membership pending the finalisation
of disciplinary proceedings against him. "The board's decision not to accept Jooste’s
resignation and to suspend his membership pending the finalisation of
disciplinary proceedings against him was made in terms of SAICA's by-laws and
was conveyed as such to Jooste’s lawyers," the statement said. The statement said SAICA's by-laws were designed to
ensure that its disciplinary inquiries are conducted in an independent, lawful
and fair manner. "Moreover, SAICA has pointed out to Jooste's
lawyers that their client cannot avoid the disciplinary inquiry that SAICA has
decided to initiate against Jooste by handing in his resignation," the statement
said.

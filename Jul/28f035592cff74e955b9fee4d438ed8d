Leading gold producer
Anglogold is pausing in the short-term before potentially renewing its uptrend.
Its share price still has large upside potential, and gold shares are very much
still an area to focus on. ANGGOLD (ANG) – Upside
breakout imminent? Recommendation:
BUY (OR ADD TO) ON A BREAKOUT Current Trend: Up on all main
timeframes. Strategy: It remains a medium-term
hold; buy/add to on a close above line 2. Chart Setup: Anggold is consolidating in a
rising wedge/triangle (lines 1 and 2). It can break out in either direction.
But the emphasis should be on the buy side. (Daily chart)  Strategy Details: Either way, it remains a
core med-term hold. If it closes above line 2 (R260.75) then add to holdings.
If not in, buy then. I would not short a breakdown of line 1 (R248 level) if
that happens. Target: Minimum target for an
upside breakout will be R285 based on the wedge (where traders can take some
profits). And for a breakdown, it’s to R230 (where one should look to buy/add
to). Stop-loss: Medium-term stop a close
below R210. (In the immediate short-term, use a close below R243).

The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have rejected the appointment of former Absa CEO to the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) interim board, claiming she won’t be able to defend the interests of public servants. “Maria Ramos will unavoidably be conflicted  and will certainly not defend the interests of government employees on the PIC board, as she has direct relationships with the companies she served as a director in.” On Wednesday, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni announced a 12-member interim board of the PIC, following the mass resignation of the old structure in February, amid claims of corruption. The EFF also described Ramos's appointment as a “perfect sign” that President Cyril Ramaphosa has “no interest in changing the status-quo” - also questioning if there were no "capable men and women, black women in particular, who could have been put in the place of Maria Ramos". In February, Ramos stepped down as Absa CEO, a position she held for 10 years. As a former Transnet CEO, the 60-year-old is no stranger to public entities.The EFF believes that her experience and ties with the corporate sector does not make her a suitable choice. “She is going to the PIC to ensure that it continues to invest in white business which she has always served.”

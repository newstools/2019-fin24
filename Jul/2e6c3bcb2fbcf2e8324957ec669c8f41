South African Airways (SAA) said in a statement it is introducing the latest technology, available in ultra-long-haul aircraft, on nonstop flights between Johannesburg and New York. SAA will supplement its existing long-haul fleet with new Airbus A350-900s, which are modern, twin-engine, wide-body aircraft.  These new-generation aircraft boast fuel-efficiency and other benefits and advantages, according to SAA. The airline said these aircraft present an opportunity for SAA to reduce fuel burn by approximately 20% compared to the aircraft currently operating on that route. This will translate into significant cost savings that will contribute towards improved operating costs and financial performance. In addition, the significance of this development is that it will add to a positive environmental impact, as SAA will also reduce its carbon emissions. SAA will lease the aircraft for up to three years. SAA will take delivery of the aircraft in the second half of 2019. The aircraft will be operational in SAA's branding as soon as SAA has met the regulatory authority requirements.

The rand strengthened to under R14/$ overnight after Fed Chairperson Jerome Powell hinted the bank may be preparing to cut interest rates. "[Powell] surprised markets with an unexpectedly dovish address to congress [on Wednesday], following the solid employment data from the economy,"Â said Bianca Botes of Peregrine Treasury Solutions in a morning note to clients. "The testimony quickly saw the rand strengthening by close to 0.8% in the afternoon, with the rally continuing in the overnight session to break below R14.00/$."    The local currency was trading at R13.95 at 08:15 on Thursday morning, its strongest level since late April 2019. "The rand is likely to lean towards more strength with the R13.80/$ level now becoming a realistic target."

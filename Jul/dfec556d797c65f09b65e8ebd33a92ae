Facebook said its applications, including the main social-media
service and Instagram photo-sharing app, were experiencing connectivity issues
on Wednesday morning. "We’re aware that some people and businesses are
currently having trouble uploading or sending images, videos and other files on
our apps. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible,” a
Facebook representative said in a statement. The company didn’t elaborate on
the reason. Tracking website Downdetector.com showed Instagram has been
having issues since 08:45 in New York, while Facebook has been having
issues since 08:04. The WhatsApp messaging service has been having issues since
09:58, Downdetector showed. Social media rival Twitter also was reporting user issues
with delivery of direct messages and notifications. "We’re working on a fix and will follow up as soon as
we have an update for you. Apologies for the inconvenience," the company
said in a tweet posted from its support account at 11:57 New York time.

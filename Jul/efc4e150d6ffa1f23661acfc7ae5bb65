The Commission of Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the governance of the Public Investment Corporation was cancelled on Monday, due to protest action taking place in Pretoria, the commission announced via its Twitter account on Monday. The cancellation comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa granted the commission its second extension, allowing the inquiry to compile and submit its final report at the end of October instead of the end of July. The commission spent much of last week hearing former PIC CEO Dan Matjila testify for the better part of four weeks. The commission’s Twitter account cited protests in the capital city as the reason why it cancelled Monday’s sitting. The account said the commission would resume on Tuesday morning.

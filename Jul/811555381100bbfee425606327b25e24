Debit and Credit aren't typically concepts you'd expect to go viral, but when they're the names of two adorable office kittens, all bets are off. The finance/ IT department of an unnamed transportation company in Ohio, US, decided to adopt two rescue kittens to boost office morale, and the cats - named Debit and Credit - went viral after an employee shared a video of them on popular online platform Reddit. The cats have since gained a following online and are being widely discussed on Twitter and Instagram. According to the employee, who chose to remain anonymous, the employees take turns to stay at the office at night, with what they called a "very sweet setup", and they added that "we visit them on the weekends for snuggling and playing." Each person in the office also takes turns on "box duty", they said. But why have they become so popular? Psychologists have argued that animals in the workplace can have beneficial effects on employee morale, including calming workers, encouraging teamwork, and encouraging breaks, which can help prevent burnout. Some research has also suggested there are health benefits for employees, including a reduction in blood pressure and the stress hormone, cortisol.

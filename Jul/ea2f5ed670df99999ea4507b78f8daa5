US markets rallied on Friday pushing equity markets into
record territory levels. The momentum continued to favour the bulls on Monday
as Asian markets and US markets continued to advance on the back of what seems
to be an imminent rate cut from the FED. The tech heavy Nikkei and Shanghai CSI
300 advanced 0.2% and 0.41% respectively, the Hang Seng advanced 0.29% whilst
the ASX200 closed the cash session in the red posting a loss of 0.65%. The continued battle between America and China continued to
rear its ugly head as China posted a weak GDP reading of 6.2% on Monday.  The Chinese authorities anticipate that the
market will continue to contract if the ongoing trade war persists.  The PBOC have already stepped in and have
indicated to the market that they will take any necessary action through open
market operations to provide relief for the market. Interest rates in mainland China have already
come into play this year, with the PBOC cutting rates and is likely to reduce
commercial bank reserve requirements in a bid to bolster production and
exports. The market is watching with bated breath key numbers out of the US
this week which could potentially keep the FED in a corner and force them to
act sooner rather than later. Gains were posted by resource counters as Assore Ltd [JSE:ASR]

to trade 0.05% firmer to trade at $1412.75/Oz. Brent crude continued to slide on Monday easing to $66/barrel as
geopolitical concerns appear to have been subdued. Iran remains a threat to the
movement of tankers within the gulf and ultimately a threat to the supply of
crude in the market. The local unit continued to strengthen against the dollar reaching
a session low of 13.85. At 17:00 CAT the Rand was trading at R13.90 against the
USD, R15.75 to the Euro and R17.56 to the Pound Sterling.

The JSE closed softer on Thursday as
financials retreated on the back of a weaker rand. The move in the rand was indirectly a
result of the euro weakening ahead of the European Central Bank's interest rate
decision and press conference which took place on Thursday afternoon. The ECB
left the main refinancing rate unchanged at 0.00%, however with the weak
economic data that has been recorded from most major European economic
powerhouses over the past month the central was expected to take a more dovish
stance on monetary policy. The euro which has been on the backfoot
against major currencies this week, fell to a two-year low as the ECB president
signaled that future interest rate cuts were in the pipeline despite holding
back for now. The US dollar advanced as a result, which saw most emerging
market currencies track lower against the greenback. The rand was not spared as
it tumbled to a session low of R14.08/$ before it was recorded trading 1.17%
weaker at R14.03/$ at 17:00. The JSE opened softer and continued to
trade weaker for the entirety of today’s session. Oil and gas producer Sasol [JSE:SOL]
fell following the release of trading statement in which it indicated that it
is expecting lower earnings per share for its full financial year. The company
also flagged the increase in the capital cost of the Lake Charles Chemical
Project as significant impairment to its profitability. The stock eventually
closed at R308.00 after falling 6.37%. Rand sensitive stocks also retreated as the
rand weakened. Retailer Mr Price [JSE:MRP] dropped 4.57% to close at R185.90,
Massmart [JSE:MSM] lost 4.22% to end the day at R60.58, and Shoprite [JSE:SHP]
fell 3.86% to close at R148.05. Coronation Fund Managers [JSE:CML] weakened by
3.76% to close at R42.98 following the release of its assets under management
statement. The banks also traded softer with losses being recorded for Standard
Bank [JSE:SBK] which dropped 3.02% to close at R184.25, as well as ABSA Group which lost 1.41% to end the day at R166.57.  Anheuser-Busch InBev [JSE:ANH] advanced on
the day mainly on the back of the release of its positive half-year results.

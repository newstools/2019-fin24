EOH has announced the resignations of several of its directors, including Zunaid Mayet, Rob Godlonton and Pumeza Bam. Mayet is Executive Director and CEO of EOH subsidiary Nextec, and has resigned as the chief executive of Nextec as well as from the EOH Holdings board and various other EOH subsidiary boards, the company said. Godlonton, who was executive director and CEO of EOH's ICT business, has resigned from his role of CEO of the ICT business and various EOH subsidiary boards. He has been at EOH for over 11 years and "has been leading the EOH ICT business in South Africa with energy and dedication", EOH said. He will assist with handover of the ICT business, the group added in a statement. Non-executive director Bam has also resigned from the EOH Holdings board and various other EOH subsidiary boards and trusts. Earlier in the year, EOH appointed Dr Xolani Mkhwanazi as group chairman, after founder and former chairman Asher Bohbot stepped down. Mkhwanazi took over the reins following a board shake-up at the group, which occurred when Microsoft terminated a contract with one of its subsidiaries. Microsoft launched a probe into the group's public sector contracts, which saw EOH's share price plummet, and EOH embarked on its own internal review of public sector contracts following allegations of corruption, which concluded in May.

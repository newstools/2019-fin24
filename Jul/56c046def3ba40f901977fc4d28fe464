the back of losses recorded amongst the index’s biggest miners. The general mining index closed
significantly weaker despite marginal gains from both the platinum and gold
mining index. Other major indices on the local bourse
also tracked lower albeit at a slower rate than the general mining index. This trend on the JSE contrasted with the
movement in Asian markets earlier which closed mostly firmer. Even Naspers struggled to gain momentum
despite Tencent Holdings closing 1.95% firmer on the Hang Seng. There was some positive news locally with

3.56%.  Gains were relatively modest for local
blue-chips in a session where only a handful advanced. Commodity trading giant Glencore [JSE:GLN]

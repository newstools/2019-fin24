Former ANC Treasurer-General Zweli Mkhize says he did not request funding from the PIC nor any other state-owned entity for the ANC January 8 statement. Mkhize issued the statement on Thursday, in response to the testimony of former PIC head Dan Matjila before the commission of inquiry on Wednesday. Matjila had told the commission that he received requests for funding from politically-connected people, from all political parties and not just the ruling party. He particularly gave an example of how the PIC was asked by a "top ANC official" to assist the ANC for its January 8 statement. But Matjila explained the asset manager cannot get involved in the funding of the ANC. Matjila said the official, whom he would not name, asked Matjila to refer the request to other possible entities who had been funded by the PIC. Matjila then referred the request to businessman Lawrence Mulaudzi for assistance. "I wish to categorically state that at no point did I, or the Treasurer General's office, request funding from any state owned entity, including the PIC," Mkhize said in a statement. Mkhize explained that the ANC through the Progressive Business Forum (PBF), facilitates engagements between business and political leaders. "As a political party, we raise funds from individuals and companies who are members of the PBF and supporters of the ANC," he said. "While I do not have any recollection of sending former CEO Mr Dan Matjila a message, it is highly likely that he may have received an invitation as an individual to one of the PBF-hosted breakfasts or dinners," Mkhize said. He added that invitations to ANC events does not mean that invitees are expected to "solicit" funds for the organisation for these events. "Fundraising is essentially about voluntary contributions," Mkhize said.

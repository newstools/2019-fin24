The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa announced on Monday that it had dismissed its company secretary, Lindikaya Zide, following a series of investigations. Zide had been placed on special leave in March. The rail agency did not say what the charges were or what Zide had been found guilty of. In response to a request for comment on the nature of the charges, Prasa said it "reserves the right to protect the confidentially of the issues". "Prasa instituted investigations against Mr. Zide on a series of charges following a lengthy investigation and a fair and transparent legal process that allowed both parties to respond and rebuttal," its statement read.Â  "Prasa has taken a decision to dismiss Mr. Zide as a result of the guilty findings." The group's Chief Strategy Officer, Dr Sipho Sithole who was placed on suspension in May, was also found guilty on five charges. "Dr Sithole will receive a 12 month suspended sanction and will serve the remainder of his contract," the statement read. Prasa did not say what Sithole had been found guilty of. "The Board of Control will continue to foster sound governance within Prasa and to clean up maladministration and the contravention of company policies with the aim of stabilising the organisation" said Khanyisile Kweyama, chairperson of Prasa's board of control.

Anglo American has announced the appointment of Nolitha Fakude as chair of the mining giant’s management board in South Africa, with effect from September 1, 2019. She will step down as a non-executive director of the board of Anglo American at the end of August in order to take up the new role. In an update to shareholders on Wednesday, Anglo said that Fakude will join the group management committee of Anglo American as Group Director – South Africa, reporting to the global mining giant's CEO, Mark Cutifani.    Her appointment follows the retirement of Norman Mbazima, announced earlier in the year. “We welcome Nolitha Fakude to our global executive team in a key strategic role that draws together our extensive business interests as the largest mining company in South Africa," Cutifani said in a statement. "Her breadth of experience at Sasol and her board experience with us and other major organisations stand her in good stead as we build upon our sustainable partnerships with all our stakeholders in South Africa.” Fakude, in a statement, said she was "looking forward to working with government and regulators to help set up South Africa’s mining industry for long term success". The new chair has served on a number of boards of JSE-listed companies, including Harmony Gold and Woolworths. Prior to joining Anglo American, she worked at Sasol until 2016, where she was executive vice president of strategy and sustainability. Anglo also announced on Wednesday that Themba Mkhwanazi, the CEO of Kumba Iron Ore since 2016, will join the group management committee of Anglo American at the start of August.

Pro-Brexit Conservative leader Boris Johnson has won the leadership race to become New British Prime Minister. Johnson came out on top, beating out Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Johnson is set to officially take over on Wednesday from outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May who stepped down on June 7 after a turbulent three years. The leadership race which has been ongoing since June 10 has seen Johnson as 'the favourite' to succeed May. Twitter was quick to react as the news of Johnson taking the helm broke, with the new British PM shooting to the top of social networking site Twitter. Many Twitter users have highlighted the similarity between Johnson and US President Donald Trump, by not only pointing out their leadership style but their similar appearance. Trump, in turn, also took to Twitter to congratulate Johnson, saying that he will ''be great'' in his new role of British Prime Minister. Many Twitter users referred to Johnson as not being 'their Prime Minister,' the same sentiment of many Americans who refer to Trump as 'not their President.'

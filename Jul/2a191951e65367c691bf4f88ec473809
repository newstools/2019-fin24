The JSE bucked the trend in other global markets as it closed firmer on Monday, mainly thanks to a rebound in mining stocks. This was in contrast to the trend recorded in Asia earlier where stocks fell in reaction to the better than expected US jobs data which was released on Friday.  The jobs data has decreased bets on the possibility of a US Fed rate cut given how healthy the US economy is, which in turn decreases the appetite for riskier assets which include stocks. The weaker trend was also recorded for major indices across Europe, as well as the US where stocks opened lower.

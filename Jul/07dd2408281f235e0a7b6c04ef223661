South African business confidence ticked higher in June, but remains below levels from a year ago after weak economic data and power blackouts in the first half of 2019.  An index measuring sentiment rose to 93.3 in June from 93 in May, the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry said Wednesday, without providing further information. Details about the performance of the sub-indexes will be published by Friday, it said in an emailed statement.

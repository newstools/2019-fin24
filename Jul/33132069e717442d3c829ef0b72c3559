A new South African app has launched to help match employers
across the country with the right staff quickly, and help job seekers find
work. Mr Employ, launched in
2018, allows job seekers to create a multimedia profile that includes a
standardised micro CV, photograph and 15-second video. Currently, there are some 70 employers and 1 200 prospective
employees using the portal. Users span industries ranging from retail
companies to call centre agencies and other industries. Managing director Ryan Oettle calls the process "quick
and intuitive" and describes the app as an "advanced smart matching
system that speeds up recruiting". 'Tinder for jobs' Describing the app as being like "Tinder for
jobs", Oettle claims it saves employers time and links employees to the
jobs they are best suited to. According to Oettle, the video feature is
"powerful" because it gives the candidate a chance to make the kind
of impression they might in an interview situation. "It gives employers a
real sense of whether the candidate will fit the culture and nature of their
business. It’s an opportunity to make a great first impression," he says. Oettle believes the app is not a threat to traditional
recruitment agencies, but rather works alongside them to "streamline"
job-hunting. The app is free for job-seekers, but employers pay R100 per
job that they upload. Asked by Fin24 what the hire rate was, Oettle said the app
developers did not access that data so as to protect users' privacy.

Airline alliance Star Alliance and IT and biometric technology company NEC Corporation have signed a partnership agreement to develop a biometric data-based identification platform that will significantly improve the travel experience for frequent flyer programme customers of Star Alliance member airlines. South African Airways (SAA) is part of Star Alliance, for example. Once implemented, Star Alliance customers who opt-in to biometrics will have a seamless and handsfree passenger experience, allowing them to pass through curb-to-gate touchpoints within airports. This would include check-in kiosks, bag-drop, lounges, and boarding gates, which traditionally require both a passport and boarding pass, by using a secure identity management solution featuring facial recognition technology. Moreover, the platform will help airports and the Star Alliance member airlines to increase operational efficiency. The service will be available to customers who are enrolled in one of the Star Alliance frequent flyer programmes and who have authorised the use of their biometric data. With a few easy steps on their mobile device, customers will have the option to enrol in the new platform using industry-leading security technology. They only need to enrol once and can then use their biometrics data multiple times at biometrics touchpoints of any participating airport whenever they travel with a Star Alliance member airline. Personal data, such as photo and other identification details, are encrypted and safely stored within the platform. From the outset, the system has been designed in compliance with applicable data protection laws making use of the latest facial recognition technology. Personal data will only be processed with the consent of the passenger. Passengers may be required to show their passport during security and immigration procedures.

The JSE rose on Friday primarily on the
back of gains recorded on the mining index as well as advances from all the
major indices. The local bourse took a leaf from trading
in Asia where stocks rallied on the back of more solid bets for a US Fed rate
cut at the next policy meeting. There are now arguments suggesting that the Fed
could actually tussle between deciding to cut rates by either 25 or 50 basis
points, However the Fed fund futures index does indicate that market
participants are currently pricing in a 25-basis points rate cut. In mainland China the Shanghai Composite
Index rallied 1.05%, while in Hong Kong the Hang Seng managed to rise 1.07%. In
Tokyo the Japanese the Nikkei closed 2% higher. Gains were fairly modest in
across the major European bourses while in the USA markets managed to open firmer. On the JSE, Pioneer Foods Group [JSE:PFG]
rocketed on the back of the news that Pepsi Co had agreed to buy the company
for about R110 per share which is a significant premium to where it is
currently trading. The stock climbed 32.09% to end the day at R102.50.
Pioneer’s biggest shareholder Zeder Investments [JSE:ZED] surged 23.17% to
close at R4.89 as it is expected to vote in favour of the buyout. Anheuser-Busch InBev [JSE:ANH] was buoyed by news that the company had agreed
to sell Carlton and United Breweries to Asahi Group. The share eventually
closed the day 5.02% higher at R1296.56. Miners traded mostly firmer on the day with
significant gains being recorded for Sibanye Stillwater [JSE:SGL] which climbed

close at R1.99, while Rebosis Property Fund [JSE:REB] weakened by 4.76% to end

R13.91/$ at 17.00 CAT. Brent crude remained relatively muted in
today’s session before it was recorded trading 0.34% firmer at $62.13/barrel just

Eskom said in an update on Saturday morning that the power system remains constrained and vulnerable. Its generating plants are performing at very low levels of reliability. With unplanned breakdowns below 9 000MW as at 08:00 on Saturday morning, Eskom cautions that the probability of loadshedding remains. It will, however, only be implemented if absolutely necessary. Currently there is sufficient diesel for its open cycle gas turbines and water at the pumped storage schemes to supplement the shortage of capacity, if required.   At the same time, any unexpected shift, such as additional unplanned breakdowns or the unavailability of diesel for open cycle gas turbines or low water levels at the pumped storage schemes, could result in loadshedding at short notice.  Unplanned outages above 9 500 MW mean Eskom has to resort to emergency power generation by using open cycle gas turbines and pumped-storage hydroelectric plants.These are very expensive ways of generating power, particularly the gas turbines, which require large quantities of diesel.

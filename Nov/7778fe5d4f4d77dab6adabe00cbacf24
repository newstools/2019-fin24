CEO of Goldman Sachs in sub-Saharan Africa, Colin Coleman (57), will retire at the end of the year. The South African investment banker was head of the Johannesburg office of Goldman Sachs since 2000, and became a partner in 2010. Coleman will become a senior fellow and lecturer at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University in 2020. At Yale, Coleman will teach a graduate-level course on "Africa: Doing Business in the Last Frontier of Global Growth". Coleman has been a board member of Business Leadership South Africa and the National Business Initiative. He is currently co-chair of the Youth Employment Service ("YES"), a private-public partnership that aims to place one million young South Africans as interns in South African businesses. Since 2017, Coleman maintained that Eskom is the biggest risk to SA's economy. "The main concern of all foreign investors is to fix Eskom," Coleman told Bloomberg last month. "We expect a phase of stabilization of Eskom in terms of governance, operations and finances to come in by the end of the year, following which a corporate restructure will start."

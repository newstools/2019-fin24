Striking unions at SAA are meeting with Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan in Pretoria, as a strike by the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the South African Cabin Crew Association enters its fifth day. Workers are demanding an 8% wage increase, no job cuts and the insourcing of employees. The cash-strapped airline has offered an increase of 5.9%. Numsa spokesperson spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola told Fin24 via WhatsApp on Tuesday that the unions were meeting with Gordhan in Pretoria. The meeting comes ahead of a planned media briefing by SAA leadership on Tuesday afternoon, where its acting SAA CEO Zuks RamasiaÂ  and its interim CFO Deon Fredericks are expected to give an update on the strike and wage negotiations.

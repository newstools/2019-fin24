Eskom says no load shedding is expected on Saturday, but warned that its power generating system remains constrained and is performing at very low levels of reliability. “With unplanned breakdowns at 8 500MW as at 06h00, the probability of load shedding remains, but will only be implemented if absolutely necessary,” said a statement. The power utility added that it has sufficient diesel for its open cycle gas turbines and water at the pumped storage schemes to supplement the shortage of capacity, if required. It said, “any unexpected shift, such as additional unplanned breakdowns, could result in load shedding at short notice.” The state-owned entity told customers that load shedding was "conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout.” Eskom is grappling with severe operational challenges, including  a debt burden of R450bn and aging power plants. Government this week announced the appointment of Andre de Ruyter as its new CEO. Ruyter will take up the position on January 15. His appointment follows the resignation of Phakamani Hadebe in July, who quit only after 16 months in the job.

The JSE retreated on Thursday as it went against the tide in other major global indices. Although modest, there was broad-based weakness recorded across most sectors on the JSE.  This contrasted with earlier trends in Asia where the Hang Seng closed 0.57% firmer, while the Nikkei and Shanghai Composite Index inched up 0.11% and 0.18% respectively. Stocks in Europe traded mostly firmer. In the US the tech-heavy Nasdaq opened slightly weaker, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones opened flat. Global sentiment was being driven by news that China had agreed with the US to roll back tariffs on each other's goods in phases. This is, however, dependent on the progress made in the agreement, which is still to be cast in stone, despite hints that a finality might only be reached in December.

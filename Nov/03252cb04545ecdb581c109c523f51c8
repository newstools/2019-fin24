Luxury jewellery design house Shimansky unveilded its new Table Mountain ring on Friday. The silhouette of Table Mountain inspired the design.  Shimansky CEO and founder Yair Shimansky says the ring pays homage to South Africa's "most iconic natural wonder...that gives Cape Town and South Africa its special presence on the globe". The ring is available in silver and all colours of gold from white, yellow or rose and in three different styles, namely plain, with a single diamond or with 27 diamonds. The Table Mountain Ring collection will be available from 1 December at the Shimansky showrooms and stores, and at the gift shop on top of Table Mountain. Wahida Parker, MD of Table Mountain Cableway, said in a statement that the project to create such a ring with an authentic SA brand like Shimansky made sense. "Ultimately it will help us share the message of the beauty of Table Mountain with even more people. Just think what a great conversation starter this will make," said Parker. The ring design was inspired by Tabe Mountain.

He has just returned from New York where he was part of an exhibition titled "The Protagonist", curated by Vogue Italia. It celebrated the world's best designers who are mindful and practice sustainability in jewellery. Shimansky showcases South Africa in his showroom on New York's iconic 5th Avenue, which opened last year. Compiled by Carin Smith

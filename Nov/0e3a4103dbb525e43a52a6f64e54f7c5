Eskom released a power alert on Monday morning, saying that while the power utility did not plan to implement any load shedding on the day, the chances of load shedding remained if an "unexpected shift in the system" occurred. "The system continues to remain extremely constrained and vulnerable, with generating (plants) performing at very low levels of reliability." The utility said it managed to avoid having to resort to load shedding since Friday and made progress in replenishing diesel for its open cycle gas turbines to increase water levels at its pumped storage schemes. Eskom had to implement load shedding last week Thursday unexpectedly. "As unplanned breakdowns remain marginally below 9500MW at 06:00, there is no load shedding expected today, but the probability of load shedding remains if there is any unexpected shift in the system," the statement said.

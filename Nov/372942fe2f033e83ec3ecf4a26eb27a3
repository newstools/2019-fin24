Eskom's system will remain constrained, but there are no plans to load shed until the end of March, executives have said. Speaking at Eskom's interim results announcement at Megawatt Park on Thursday, chairperson and acting CEO Jabu Mabuza said the system remains vulnerable. "We are not planning to load shed. We continue to be tight," Mabuza said. General manager of system operator, Bernard Magoro said that the system is expected to do better from March. "From March onwards we should be okay. Again, it depends on the level of maintenance that we will be able to execute in this time. We are not planning any load shedding until the end of March," Magoro said. The winter plan is expected to be shared towards the end of March. On Thursday morning Eskom issued a statement indicating that the system remains "constrained and vulnerable" and that generating plants are performing at "very low levels of reliability". Eskom said in its statement that the probability of load shedding remains â€“ but will only be implemented if absolutely necessary. Eskom reported a R1.3bn net profit for the first half of the year, but anticipates a R20bn full-year loss, Fin24 reported.

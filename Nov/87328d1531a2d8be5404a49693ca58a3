Transnet hiked its profits for the past half-year despite flat freight volumes. The state-owned freight rail and port operator increased its revenue by almost 3% to R38.7bn in the six months to end-September, while its profit (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) were up by 5% to R17.5bn. Its freight rail division increased its revenue by 3.5% to R22.8bn thanks to a hike of more than 4% in its income per ton, from R195.40 to R203.63 . Freight volumes increased marginally from 109.2 million tons to 109.3mt, in large part due to a boost in the export iron ore, which saw a 3% increase in freight volumes. Export coal volumes, meanwhile, increased by 0.6%. The group's general freight business volumes (which exclude export iron ore and coal) declined, which it blamed primarily on “the prevailing weak economic climate”. In addition, heavy flooding and derailings contributed to a 21% fall in cement and lime freight volumes, while domestic coal decreased by 7.1% to 7.8mt “mainly due to multiple customer cancellations, with vessel delays at the Richards Bay port resulting in full stockpiles”. Volumes in the iron, steel and scrap sectors fell by 12.5% due to reduced demand from customers. Grain, stock feed and milling volumes also fell, mainly due to the late start of the summer grain season, which was delayed by three months. Freight volumes of mining minerals, meanwhile, increased by almost 21% to 6.4mt, while manganese volumes increased by 7.0% to 7.6mt, mainly due to the new 375-wagon long train – the world’s longest - on the Sishen-Saldanha ore line. It also saw 21% growth in freight volumes of raw sugar and barley.   Transnet ports While revenue from its port operations increased by almost 6% to R7.1 billion, container volumes decreased by almost 4%. The container sector was impacted by adverse weather conditions, equipment challenges and a go-slow at the ports in July 2019. The Richards Bay Dry Bulk Terminal’s loading rate, meanwhile, improved from 823 tons per hour to 864 tons per hour. The Saldanha iron ore terminal maintained its average tons dual loaded per hour above the target of 8 094 tons per hour. Cost cutting Across the business, net operating expenses increased by a percent to R21.2 billion due to a 5.8% increase in personnel cost and a 5.1% increase in electricity. An increase in security incidents, which hit its freight rail division, resulted in an 18% increase in security costs. But the company implemented strict cost cutting, including rationalising overtime, reducing consulting fees and limiting discretionary costs relating to travel, printing, stationery and telecommunications. Net finance costs decreased by 1.4% to R5,57 billion. Its long-term debt fell from R115bn to R105bn since March, while short-term loans amounted to R19.4bn.

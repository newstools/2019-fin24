long-term investment holding company seeking to drive growth and value creation
via its portfolio of sizeable, unlisted businesses in the broad consumer

at the appropriate time." "The board has resolved to adopt a new strategy focused
on maximising value through the realisation of its existing assets in its
portfolio over the next five years and returning capital to shareholders." The group also announced that its board had

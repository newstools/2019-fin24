Andre de Ruyter, current CEO of Nampak, has been appointed as the new chief executive of Eskom and will assume his duties on January 15, the Ministry of Public Enterprises has said. He has more than 20 years of experience at petrochemicals group Sasol in a number of senior management roles, the ministry said in a statement on Monday. He replaces former chief Phakamani Hadebe, who stepped down in July, citing health concerns. Chair Jabu Mabuza stood in as acting CEO. Tough job, smaller package The Department of Public Enterprises thanked De Ruyter for accepting the position "at a difficult time for Eskom" as well as a compensation package lower "than the position currently pays", in view of the entity's dire financial situation. It did not give further details of the package in its statement.   Among other things, De Ruyter will lead the re-organisation of the power utility, including its separation into three entities responsible for generation, transmission and distribution. According to a statement from the Department of Public Enterprises, a lengthy process was followed to make the appointment. De Ruyter was chosen from 142 potential candidates, eight of whom were Eskom employees, said the ministry. A list of 17 individuals was shortlisted, but eight withdrew, after which the Board interviewed six candidates. After further interviews, three candidates were submitted in terms of Eskom's Memorandum of Incorporation with government, Public Enterprises said. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed a team of Cabinet ministers to consider the recommendations, and they agreed, according to the department. * This is a developing story.

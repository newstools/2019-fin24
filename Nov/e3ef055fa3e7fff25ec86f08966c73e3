The JSE got off to a strong start for the
week as it closed firmer on Monday led by gains on the industrials index. The local bourse took a leaf from the
firmer closes in Asian markets where the Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite Index
closed 1.35% and 0.8% higher respectively, while the Nikkei managed gains of
0.49%. Unfortunately, this momentum did not carry
into the European trading session where stocks traded mostly softer. The drop in European stocks coincided with
the drop in US equity futures which retreated on the back of renewed pessimism
about a trade deal being reached between the USA and China. Weakness was also recorded for rand which
weakened against the US dollar to a session low of R14.82/$. The local unit was
recorded trading 0.69% weaker at R14.80/$ at 17:00. Industrials led gains on the local bourse
mainly on the back of gains recorded in index heavyweights Naspers and Prosus. Prosus [JSE:PRX] which is subsidiary of
Naspers released a half-year trading statement indicating that company is
expecting a small increase in core headline earnings, which resulted in the
stock closing 2.5% higher at R1012.49. Naspers [JSE:NPN] which also released a
trading statement recorded gains of 2.37% to close at R2160.00. Netcare [JSE:NTC] highlighted a significant
jump in headline earnings per share in its full-year results which saw the
stock rally 5.16% to close at R18.55. Rand hedge, British American Tobacco
[JSE:BTI] gained 2.58% as it closed at R549.85, while Sappi [JSE:SAP] managed

included Hammerson PLC [JSE:HMN] which advanced 2.48% to close at R55.41,
Sibanye Gold [JSE:SGL] which rose 1.64% to close at R28.48, and Bid Corporation
[JSE:BID] which closed at R344.19 after gaining 1.61%.  Of the day’s losers, KAP Industrial
Holdings [JSE:KAP] came under significant pressure as it fell 4.93% to close at
R4.24. Investment holding company, Long4Life

Vodacom [JSE:VOD] fall 1.51% to close at R128.98, while ABSA Group [JSE:ABG]
lost 1.45% to close at R160.52. Gold miners traded moderately softer as

as well as Gold Fields [JSE:GFI] which dropped 0.22% to close at R79.90. Losses were also recorded for Old Mutual

because of the weaker rand as it lost 0.31%, however the Industrials and
Resources indices gained 1.28% and 0.65% respectively. Brent crude retreated as news of China’s
pessimism about getting a trade deal surfaced. The commodity was trading 0.96% softer at
$62.69/barrel just after the JSE close.

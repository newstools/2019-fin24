Telkom’s [JSE: TKG] profit took a hit in the six months to end-September
as it invested billions in mobile and fibre services. Its headline earnings fall 36%, while its net debt increased
by almost R2 bn to R11.8bn as it invested R4.2bn into mobile
and fibre services. It increased its number of mobile base stations by almost
25% to 5 476. It also invested into
preparations to upgrade customers to LTE and fibre. Telkom said it now has the
highest connectivity rate for fibre to the home in the market. Telkom increased its revenue by 4.7% to R21.5 billion, with
its mobile service revenue up 56.6% to R5 602bn. The number of mobile subscribers rose by 76% to 11.5m customers. Telkom increased its dealer network to accommodate growth. "However, we unfortunately
experienced unsavoury dealer behaviour that
drove the pre-paid acquisition of the low-end
value voice-only subscribers." Telkom said its "rebalanced" the base, after implementing punitive
action against the selected dealers, but this has
resulted in the 13.3% decline in pre-paid
average revenue per user (ARPU). ARPU from contract clients declined by 7.0%, primarily due to
the repositioning of entry-level deal. Telkom's share price lost more than a third since June.

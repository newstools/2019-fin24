Eskom said in a statement on Sunday morning that it wants to remind South Africans that loadshedding is a last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout.  Fin24 reported earlier that, after some of Eskom's generating units failed over last weekend, power supply was running dangerously low by Wednesday morning.Unplanned outages above 9 500 MW mean Eskom has to resort to emergency power generation by using open cycle gas turbines and pumped-storage hydroelectric plants.These are very expensive ways of generating power, particularly the gas turbines, which require large quantities of diesel.

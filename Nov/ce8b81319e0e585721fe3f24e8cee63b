Multichoice expects to report headline earnings growth of between
20% to 25% for the six months to end-September. Trading profit is expected to be between 20% (R800m) and 25%
(R1bn) higher than the prior year´s R3.9bn. “The improved financial performance expected for the current
period is despite continued macro-economic headwinds faced across the
continent, which are impacting disposable income at a consumer level.
Management has remained focused on tight cost controls to offset these
challenges and continued to reduce losses in the rest of Africa segment, which
has been the largest contributor to the improvement in group performance,” the
group said in a statement. Multichoice also benefited from a lower depreciation of the rand
against the US dollar compared to the prior period which has led to a decrease
in unrealised foreign exchange losses. Its results will be released on November 11th. After being unbundled out of Naspers, Multichoice was listed
on the JSE in February. Its share price was up since listing, and gained another half a percent on Thursday. Fin24 is part of the Media24 stable, which is owned
by Multichoice.

The JSE retreated on Wednesday as it tracked weaker global
sentiment which was ignited by Donald Trump's threats of additional tariffs if
no deal is reached in the current talks with China. Trump's comments were much anticipated on Tuesday given the
rally recorded last week on the back of Chinese led comments about a potential
roll back on tariffs if trade talks go well. Market participants were also
anticipating Fed chair, Jerome Powell's testimony at Congress which is expected
at 18:00. The Fed chairman reiterated that the Fed's current policy is
appropriate although prior noted risks remain. Concerns over the Hong Kong
unrest also continue to deter markets particularly in Asia.  Locally, focus was on the release of South Africa's retail
sales numbers for the month of September. The data mostly disappointed as
retail sales Year-on-Year only expanded by 0.2%, widely missing a forecast of
2.0%. Retail sales Month-on-Month advanced 0.5% barely missing an estimate of
0.6%. The rand came under pressure as a result of this data as it
reached a session low of R15.00/$. At 17:00, the rand was trading 0.4% weaker
at R14.99/$. Following the prior session's rally, Telkom [JSE:TKG] came
relinquished most of those gains as it closed 5.38% lower at R62.58. Blue Label
Telecoms [JSE:BLU] which also had a surge on Tuesday, fell 4.27% to close at R2.69.
Index heavyweight Naspers [JSE:NPN] came under considerable pressure as it lost
2.25% to end the day at R2106.53, while Prosus [JSE:PRX] fell 2.36% to close at
R994.00. Financials hit a snag on the back of the weaker rand which
saw declines being recorded for FirstRand [JSE:FSR] which dropped 1.96% to
close at R67.53, while Standard Bank [JSE:SBK] lost 1.07% to close at R174.85. Other significant losers on the day included Brait [JSE:BAT]
which fell 3.78% to close at R16.31, Multichoice Group [JSE:MCG] which lost 2.43%
to close at R125.50, and Vodacom Group [JSE:VOD] which closed at R133.53 after
losing 1.27%. Harmony Gold [JSE:HAR] was buoyed by the release of a
positive operational update which showed higher production and lower costs. The
stock rallied 8.01% to close at R49.08. Other gold miners also recorded gains
on the day which saw stocks such as DRD Gold [JSE:DRD] surge 6.36% to close at
R6.69, and AngloGold Ashanti [JSE:ANG] gained 5.15% to close at R297.50. The Spar Group [JSE:SPP] bucked the downward trend recorded
in other retailers as it was buoyed by the release of its full-year results
which showed decent increases in earnings and turnover. The stock closed 5.55%
to close at R209.00. Coal miner Exxaro Resources [JSE:EXX] added 3.83% to close
at R130.00, while Kumba Iron Ore [JSE:KIO] rose 3.77% to close at R382.32. The JSE All-Share index eventually closed 0.26% weaker while
blue-chip JSE Top-40 index shed 0.19%. The resources index managed to gain
0.95%, while the industrials and financials indices shed 0.67% and 0.82%
respectively. Brent crude held steady as it was recorded trading 0.34%
firmer at $62.27/barrel just after the JSE close. At 17:00, palladium was up 0.62% at $1710.25/Oz, platinum
was 0.31% firmer at $871.90/Oz, and gold had risen 0.46% to trade at
$1463.71/Oz. *Musa Makoni is a trading specialist at Purple Group

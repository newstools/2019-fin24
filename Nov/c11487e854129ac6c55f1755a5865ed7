A judge at the High Court in Pretoria will next week rule whether former SAA chairperson Dudu Myeni will be allowed to amend her pleadings and if the rest of SAA directors, who served with her on the board, could join her in the delinquency case she is facing. Myeni's attorney, Nqabayethu Buthelezi, had yesterday told the court that Myeni intended to correct factual errors in the plea she made earlier, arguing that they were made in error and that she was not legally aware of what her previous attorneys had filed on her behalf. In the papers before the court, Myeni further stated that "new facts had been discovered since the filing of the plea in 2017" and that such information was materially relevant to her defence. She also wants the rest of the board of directors who served with her to be brought in to face the same charge as her. A ruling on the amendments is expected on Monday. Myeni served as chairperson of SAA between December 2012 an October 2017. OUTA claims that SAA recorded losses of up R16.844bn during Myeni's time at the airline, something she has denied. Myeni sits on the boards of 13 companies, according to documentation presented in court. Being found to be delinquent would prevent her from serving as a director. She has not attended the court proceedings since the hearing began in October, following numerous delays. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA), which brought the case against Myeni, together with SAA Pilots Association, said the inaction of SAA and other government agencies prompted it to pursue the matter and that the case is in the public interest.

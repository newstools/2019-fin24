South African Airways acting CEO Zukisa Ramasia told
reporters on Sunday evening that the national carrier would never jeopardise
the safety of its passengers or staff, after striking unions claimed flying
with the airline on that evening would be a safety risk. National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa and the South
African Cabin Crew Association urged South Africans not to fly with South
African Airways on Sunday afternoon, following the national carrierâ€™s
announcement that international flights would be reinstated. Ramasia urged the unions to retract the statements about
safety at SAA's operations being compromised. She reminded reporters that
pilots were on duty and called for an end to intimidation of working staff. NUMSA spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola,
during a briefing held at OR Tambo International Airport on Sunday afternoon
warned that learners in the technical support environment were being used to
give SAA capacity to operate flights while the strike continues. NUMSA chair at SAA Technical, Areheng Ndlovu, said aircraft
must not be allowed to fly an aircraft without the sign-off of a technician
like him.

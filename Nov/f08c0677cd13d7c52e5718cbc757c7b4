Recruitment
group Adcorp [JSE:ADR] has appointed Talib Sadik as interim
chief financial officer with immediate effect, to enable interim CEO Cheryl-Jane
Kujenga to focus on her role as interim chief executive, the company said in a
statement on Monday. Sadik is a Denel
board member and audit committee chair. He previously held executive positions
at De Beers group services and Basil Read. In October,
Adcorp said it had seen a 10% drop in revenue year-on-year, and R447m in net
losses, amid poor trading conditions in South Africa and extreme weather
conditions in Australia that hurt its earnings. It recently
saw the resignation of its CEO, Innocent Dutiro. Kujenga - the former CFO - stepped in as interim CEO.

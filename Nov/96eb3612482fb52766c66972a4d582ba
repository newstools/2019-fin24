Leadership South Africa, has been appointed the new chairperson of the
Bidvest Group.Â He has been a non-executive director of Bidvest since July 1, 2019. In an update to shareholders, Bidvest said his appointment was
effective as of Friday. Eric Diack, who filled the position of chairperson temporarily
since May 2019, will revert to being lead independent director. Mohale announced in late in June that his contract at BLSA
would not be renewed. Earlier in the year he co-founded a startup called
SiSebenza with Marc Lubner, Gary Woolf and Andrew Robinson in early 2019, focusing
on entrepreneur and small business support.

The JSE managed to close firmer on Friday
despite earlier declines as it surged on the back of gains in the resources
index. The local bourse got off to a slow start as
it retreated marginally in earlier trading before it found momentum towards the
afternoon session. Trading in Asia was mixed earlier on as the
Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.02%, while the Nikkei and Hang Seng inched up
0.32% and 0.48% respectively. Stocks in Europe also tracked higher as
there wasn't much deviation to the trade talks headlines that were released in
the prior session. The momentum in Europe held despite mostly
lower than expected manufacturing and services PMI readings for most members of
the bloc. The rand strengthened against the greenback
as it peaked at a session high of R14.59/$. However, the local unit
relinquished most of these gains as it was recorded trading 0.04% firmer at R14.67/$

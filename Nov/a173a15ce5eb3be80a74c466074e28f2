Zimbabwean lithium company Prospect Resources, which is listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, says its ultra-low iron petalite product has passed the stringent technical specifications of the global glass-ceramic market. Within the glass-ceramics market, ultra-low iron petalite is a key ingredient in the manufacture of dark glass. It is used in the glass and ceramics industry, for example in the production of glass-ceramics cooktops. Prospect said in an update to shareholders that it had provided two of the world’s largest glass-ceramic manufacturers with samples for laboratory testing and analysis. "The outcomes from their analysis is that the ultra-low iron petalite meets the glass-ceramic market’s stringent technical specifications," the group said in a statement. The miner’s flagship project is the Arcadia Lithium project, located in Goromonzi, roughly 50 kilometres south-east of Harare. "Prospect anticipates being one of only two mines in the world capable of producing ultra-low iron petalite and we expect to be the largest player in this natural oligopoly – none of which are based in Australia," said Prospect in a statement. "Demand for the company’s ultra-low iron petalite is expected to be spread equally between Europe and Asia, with considerable supply deficit for the foreseeable future." The company added that its low iron petalite product has met specification testing for ceramic production in Japan and China.

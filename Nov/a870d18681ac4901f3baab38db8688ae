In a statement on Tuesday morning, Kumba cut its sales forecast
for the year following the news that ArcelorMittal SA will shut down its Saldanha
steel plant. Kumba sells iron ore to ArcelorMittal SA, which uses its product to produce
steel. Kumba has reduced its 2019 total sales guidance to 41.5 to 42.5m
tonnes from 42 to 43mt. The production guidance for the full year 2019 is
unchanged at 42 to 43mt. But Kumba said that export sales still contribute 94% towards the
company’s total sales. “Kumba’s high-quality iron ore products are well-positioned
in global markets with ongoing customer demand and a stable export order book,”
the company said. AMSA is still reviewing its remaining SA operations, and Kumba
said it will continue to assess the effect of this review.

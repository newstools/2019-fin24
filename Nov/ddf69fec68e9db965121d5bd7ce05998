uptick in September, only the third time this year that volumes have increased. According to StatsSA, production across all mineral groups was up 0.2% in September 2019 when compared to September 2018. This was mainly

2018. Annual bullion production fell by 19% in April, 24.3% in May, 16% in June, 13.5% in July and 5.3% in August. Diamond production, meanwhile, fell by 15.7%.

The JSE traded mostly flat on Thursday before it closed softer as stocks struggled for direction. Today was mostly a data driven trading session starting off with weaker than expected economic data out of China and Japan. Japan released its preliminary GDP QoQ reading which fell shy of expectations at 0.2% as it was recorded at 0.1%. Jitters were triggered by industrial production data out of China which came in at 4.7% YoY, missing estimates of 5.5%. Chinese retail sales YoY were recorded at 7.2% which missed forecasts of 7.2%. In Europe, the German economy barely missed going into a technical recession as GDP QoQ expanded by 0.1% from a prior recording of -0.1%. European Union GDP numbers came in line with expectations at 0.2%, however the data from Asia had already done enough to induce fears. Locally, Statistics SA released slightly improved mining production numbers for the month of September. Mining production YoY expanded by 0.2% from a prior contraction of -3.0%, while mining production MoM expanded by 1.5% easily beating the forecast of 0.6%.

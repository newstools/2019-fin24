African Bank Holdings saw its profits after tax jump 13% to
R1.15bn as it continued to focus on building trust and diversifying offerings. African Bank and African Bank Holdings both released annual
results for the year ended September 30 on Tuesday. African Bank said its 'MyWORLD' transactional banking product
– which had previously only been rolled out to employees – had successfully
been introduced to the public, signalling a "new phase in the bank's
growth". "An increasing number of retail deposit customers
continue to show trust in the bank, as evidenced by the significant increase in
savings and investments deposits," it added. According to the statement, retail customer deposits stood
at R2.3bn, up from R1.1bn in 2018. In a statement issued on the JSE Stock Exchange News
Service, the group also emphasised a focus on stricter lending criteria, saying
the bank "continued to be a responsible provider of unsecured credit to South
African consumers". "Credit risk continues to be well within the bank’s
risk appetite, while new credit disbursements have increased against a backdrop
of stricter credit underwriting criteria," the statement said. Earlier in November, the bank announced
it was partnering with TransUnion Credit Bureau to allow consumers unlimited
access to their detailed credit report, which was previously only available
at no charge once a year. According to its integrated report, the re-launched African Bank's strategy focuses both on rebuilding public trust and diversifying its offering in order to ensure future sustainability. Current CEO Basani Maluleke was appointed in 2018.

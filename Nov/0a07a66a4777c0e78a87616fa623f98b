The JSE extended its gains on Friday led
yet again by gains on the resources index. With Moody’s Investors Service scheduled to release South Africa’s ratings review on Friday evening, local stocks edged higher despite a rather pessimistic outlook from investors given Wednesday’s budget speech. The local bourse also rose in line with other global stocks which were upbeat thanks to better than expected Chinese manufacturing data as well as a surprise beat in US jobs data. The rand held steady against the US dollar
following consecutive sessions of weakness. However, volatility is expected when
Moody’s announces South Africa’s sovereign rating. The rand fell to a session
low of R15.16/$ before it was recorded trading 0.23% firmer at R15.05/$ at
17.00 CAT. On the JSE, Impala Platinum [JSE:IMP]
closed amongst the day’s biggest gainers after advancing 3.6% to close at R107.59.
Commodity trading giant Glencore [JSE:GLN] also recorded decent gains as it
ended the day 3.22% higher at R46.86. Diversified mining giant Anglo American [JSE:AGL] advanced 2.08% to close at R394.66, while its sector peer BHP [JSE:BHP] climbed 1.44% to close at R325.34. Retailer, Massmart [JSE:MSM]
rose 2.84% to end the day at R44.12, while Shoprite [JSE:SHP] posted gains of 1.33%

to close at R8.77, and Intu Properties [JSE:ITU] lost 1.71% to close at R8.62.

firmer while the broader JSE All-Share index gained 0.41%. The Financials index
was the only index to close softer as it lost 0.3%. The Industrials and

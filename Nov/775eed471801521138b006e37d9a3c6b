South African business confidence remained weak in October, according to the SA Chamber
of Commerce and Industry. The chamber announced on Thursday that its index tracking business confidence fell to 91.7 in October from 92.4 in September. It is only the fourth
time the index has dipped below the 92 point mark since 2012. The index was pushed down form the previous month due
to lower merchandise exports and imports, and to a lesser degree from a fall in
the rand/dollar exchange rate and disrupted energy supplies caused by load
shedding. A boost to new vehicle sales and lower consumer inflation, provided some pushback. "The static level of the [confidence index] shows the
market frustration, reflected in the BCI, to gain traction and build the
necessary momentum which could support a turnaround of general economic
conditions and sentiment," the chamber said in statement. "Business confidence remains at a plateau while
policymakers have little manoeuvring space to set the economy on course. Credit
rating agencies, lenders and investors are reluctant to make decisions in an
uncertain environment. The need for economic growth and reducing unemployment
must take centre stage." - Compiled by Jan Cronje

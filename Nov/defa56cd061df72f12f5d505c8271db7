President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed three new envoys, including two former ministers, to help with his drive to attract $100bn in new investment. Former Energy Minister Jeff Radebe has been appointed to drive investment in the oil and gas industry, the Presidency said in a statement on Monday. Derek Hanekom, former minister of tourism, will have a similar remit in the tourism industry, alongside Elizabeth Thabethe, the current deputy tourism minister. South Africa is scheduled to hold an investment conference in Johannesburg from November 5 to 7. Ramaphosa has also established an investment and infrastructure office, to be headed by former Gauteng MEC for Economic Development, Kgosientso Ramokgopa, the presidency said.

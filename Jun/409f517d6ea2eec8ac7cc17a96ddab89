Stocks on the JSE struggled for direction on Wednesday as they lacked a catalyst both locally and from international markets. Stocks in Asia also traded mostly flat aiding to the local index's lack of direction.  This trend persisted on major European counters as well as the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices in the US which opened relatively flat. The exception was the Nasdaq which recorded decent gains as tech stocks surged after Micron Technologies Inc beat profit estimates in its latest earnings release. Caution remains the default state for investors as they await the next tweet from Donald Trump which could potentially cause a swing in the markets. With US GDP numbers expected on Thursday, investors will eagerly be looking to get a clearer understanding of the impact of the ongoing US-China trade war on economic growth.

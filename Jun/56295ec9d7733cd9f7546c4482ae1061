The South African Broadcasting Corporation has dismissed the Thobela FM executive producer Sam Mochichila after finding him guilty of soliciting a bribe in exchange for a job contract extension, the public service broadcaster confirmed on Wednesday. Sowetan reported on Wednesday morning that Mochichila had been dismissed by the SABC after being found guilty of getting R2000 from former current affairs producer and presenter Tlou Moabelo to secure an extension of her contract at the public service broadcaster.  Approached for comment, SABC spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu confirmed the dismissal, but said the broadcaster would not be commenting any further on the matter. "The SABC can confirm that Sam Mochichila is no longer within the employ of the SABC, following a disciplinary hearing. This was a matter between the SABC and Mr Mochichila and therefore the SABC will not go into the details or comment further," said Mthembu.

The good times continued to roll for world equity markets on Thursday, as the Dow and S&P continued to post solid gains in the US session. Asian markets were mixed, with the tech heavy Nikkei and Shanghai CSI 300 easing 0.01% and 0.9% respectively, the Hang Seng and the ASX200 closed the cash session in the black posting gains of 0.26% and 0.38% respectively. The markets continue to hold onto the prospects of a FED rate cut next month, however the lack of progress in Sino-US trade war continues to weigh down the new-found optimism. The European Central Bank (ECB) President, Mario Draghi, indicated that the governing council of the ECB would hold back on a rate hike as the Eurozone’s economy begins to feel the effects of the China-US trade war. The Euro advanced against the dollar after the announcement as carry trade players sought to take positions in the Euro with an anticipation of a widening interest rate differential between the US and the Euro zone within the next month. The ECB appeared reluctant to increase rates as peripheral European economies still require additional support to navigate the current depressed economy. On the local front, President Ramaphosa on Wednesday met with executives from 20 state-owned entities, including Eskom and South African Airways, to reassure them of the shareholder's support and address their concerns. Eskom and SAA continue to be the largest dependents of state funding and are the government's achilles heel in the effort to overhaul the economy.

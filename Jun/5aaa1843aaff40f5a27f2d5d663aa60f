Lanxess and the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa have reached an agreement, ending an underground sit-in by nearly 300 workers that lasted over a week, the company said in a statement on Thursday evening. Details of the agreement were not specified. "The company welcomes the agreement and is relieved that the conflict could be resolved successfully," said General Manager Ben Marais. The labour action started on the morning of June 19, 2019, when 290 Numsa members embarked on an underground sit-in strike during their day shift.Â Workers were protesting against the alleged inaction of management in a sexual harassment incident as well as the dismissal of 56 fellow employees, whom they wanted reinstated. * More to follow.

The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Commission announced on Wednesday that power utility Eskom failed to comply with the B-BBEE Act when it awarded a tender for a boiler at Duvha Power Station to a Chinese owned entity. The commission said the Chinese company does not meet B-BBEE requirements.  "As a result, the commission has recommended to Eskom to cancel the contract and to conduct an independent audit of all its contracts above R1 billion from 2014 to check compliance with B-BBEE requirements," it said in a statement. A probe found that Dongfang Electric Corporation had 0% black ownership, said the commission. Fin24 could not immediately reach Eskom for comment. * More to come

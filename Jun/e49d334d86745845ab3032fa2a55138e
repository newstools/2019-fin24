The petrol price will decrease by nearly R1 from July 3, the Department of Energy announced on Friday. The price of 93 ULP will go do down by 96 cents a litre, while 95 ULP will cost 95 cent less a litre. Diesel will decrease by 79 cents per litre. The department said the main reason for the downward adjustment was a drop in the price of Brent Crude Oil, which went $71.29 per barrel to $63.60 during the period under review. “International factors include the fact that South Africa imports both crude oil and finished products at a price set at the international level, including importation costs,” the department said in a statement. The wholesale price for illuminating paraffin will cost 57 cents less per litre.

Stocks closed the week in the black as key economic data was largely ignored by the market. The dominant themes this week were that of quality easing and interest rate cuts.  Its has now become clear that Donald Trump twisted the hand of the FED, as many Governors believe that given the current conditions in the market there is no room for rate hikes. The US economy faces a low interest and low inflation regime, which the Trump regime would like to see to boost economic growth. The Reserve Bank of Australia managed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points this week, however the European Central Bank failed to move on interest rates, sighting the current Sino-US trade war as the major hurdle for any interest rate cut or hike. The monthly non-farm payroll numbers released on Friday missed market expectations, however equity markets continued to rally as this solidified market expectations of an interest rate cut. The existing commodity market dichotomy still has the market anticipating what the next moves will be in the commodity market.  Market fundamentals point to a much higher oil price, with the current trade embargoes on Iran and Venezuela’s limiting oil output in these key oil exporting nations. Moves in precious metals have followed market expectations higher.Significant gains were made by Delta Property Fund [JSE:DLT] which gained 6.97% on the day to trade at 215c, Platinum miner Royal Bafokeng [JSE:RBP] had a sterling day adding 6.76%.

Equity markets continued to rally on Wednesday as the voices of a US rate cut rang louder across global markets. Asian markets bounced off session lows to trade mainly in the black, the Nikkei was up 1.8%, whilst the Hang Seng gained 0.5% and the Asx200 was up 0.41%. The Shanghai CSI 300 closed the day 0.04% in the red to trade at 3597 points. GDP numbers released out of Australia on the day indicated that the economy grew by 0.4% in the last quarter, below the market forecast of 0.5%. This point justifies the Reserve Bank of Australia’s move yesterday to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. The Standard Bank PMI for May came in at 49.3, declining from 50.3.  An index reading of 50 or more represents an expansion, a reading below 50 suggests that the economy is contracting. This is in line with a 3.2% slump in GDP in the first quarter.

Online travel agency Travelcheck has launched in South Africa. The new company is a privately funded venture and offers flight and hotel bundles, online booking for all major airlines, and more than 300 000 hotels around the world.  Travelcheck.co.za says it differentiates from other online booking websites with packages which enable travellers to custom create holidays. Pre-defined packages are also available to book should travellers desire recommendations. "We are excited to launch Travelcheck in South Africa," said CEO Odette Faling. "Travellers can save up to 25% by booking flights and hotels in a bundle rather than reserving these components separately, and features such as dynamic packages will give South Africans more choices when booking travel online," Faling said in a statement. The flight search engine features "Quick Share" to facilitate seamless itinerary and price sharing to third-party messaging apps such as WhatsApp directly from the search results page. "Mix & Match" allows travellers to book more than one airline in the same ticket â€“ for example, travellers can choose to fly from Cape Town to London on British Airways and return on Turkish Airlines without booking separate segments. Travelcheck has partnered with third parties to offer useful ancillaries which can be added during the online booking, including: lost luggage insurance, a cancellation and refund policy and flight ticket amendments. "Dynamic packages and bundled bookings have helped travellers in more developed markets save time and money. We're enthusiastic about being the first to bring this technology to South Africa," said Faling.

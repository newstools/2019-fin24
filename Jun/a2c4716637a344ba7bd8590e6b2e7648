News24 is SA's most trusted news brand according to research by the Reuters Institute. According to the recently released 2019 Reuters Institute Digital News Report, News24 trumps 12 other news publications in terms of its trust scores. "News24 has a strong reputation for trust built on the back of investments in breaking news," the report read. News24 editor-in-chief Adriaan Basson said the acknowledgment by the Reuters Institute was "incredible and humbling". "The recognition is testament to the investment Media24 has made over the past decade to improve the quality and quantity of News24’s journalism. I am incredibly proud to lead a team of such hard-working and dedicated journalists, who have embraced technology and data to give their stories wings." Basson said trust and integrity are key ingredients for any successful journalistic brand. "With so much fake news around and the resistance of social platforms to act against the purveyors of misinformation and hate, readers are increasingly turning to us for the truth and balanced opinion. We must earn that trust and the only way to do so is through quality journalism." The Reuters Institute also noted that the online news space is dominated by the News24 brand. "This success is partly a consequence of its parent company’s early adoption of the potential of the internet and prescient attention to mobile delivery platforms, but also a testament to News24’s focus on making news that is designed for digital consumption timelines and attention spans," the report read.

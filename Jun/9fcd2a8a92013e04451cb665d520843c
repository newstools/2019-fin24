World Equity markets provided yet another strong performance
on Monday as the risk on trade gathers momentum.  The JSE recorded the 6 consecutive positive
close for the month of June, as world markets continued to advance on the back of
interest rate cuts in the US. The Trump administration   has indicated that it will not raise tariffs
on Mexico as the Mexican government has shown signs that it will control the
“caravan” of immigrants from South America. Chinese markets played catch-up on Monday after having been
closed for a public holiday on Friday. The Hang Seng advanced 2.27% whilst the
Shanghai based CSI 300 was up 1.29%, Tencent holdings [700:Hk] gained 3.81% to
close the day at $343 HKD. Lonmin Plc [JSE:LON] bade farewell to the JSE
today as the platinum giant concluded the take over from Sibanye Gold [JSE:SGL].
Shareholders in Lonmin Plc [JSE:LON] will receive Sibanye Gold [JSE:SGL]
shares for
their shareholding. It is fitting to say au revoir to the mining giant that has
managed to pull herself out of quicksand after years of recording losses. The management will surely pop their last
bottles (if they have not already) of fine French Champagne to mark the end of
their 110year history, which could have ended in disaster if management had
failed to beautify the old lass for takeover from Sibanye gold. The Tongaat Hulett [JSE:TON] debacle took another turn on Monday
as management of the Sugar producer requested the suspension in the trading of
their shares.  This course of action was
taken by management after they announced last week that they will delay the
release of their financials. The
restated results are expected to be released in October 2019, the group
anticipates that the company’s securities will remain suspended until
then. The company has stated that it may
ask for an earlier reinstatement of trading in their shares if there is need to
do so. Before its suspension on the JSE Tongaat Hulett was trading at 1321c a
level last seen in 1993, 3 years after; listing in August of 1990. The pendulum swung in favour of the retailers, financials and the
property stocks on the local bourse today. Strong gains were posted by Rebosis
Property Fund [JSE:REB] , Dis-Chem Pharmacies [JSE:DCP] and Woolworths Holdings [JSE:WHL] which advanced
7.32%, 5.65% and 4.76% respectively. The rand hedges were weaker today after having posted strong gains
since the beginning of the month.  The
mining stocks retreated the most today Royal Bafokeng Platinum [JSE:RBP], ArcelorMittal [JSE:ACL],
Harmony Gold  [JSE:HAR] and Anglogold
Ashanti [JSE:ANG], shed 7.99%, 5.92%,

hands at $63.26 per barrel at 17:00 CAT. The Rand was firmer on the day as the currency market saw more
risk on trades. The Rand was trading at R14.76 against the $USD, R16.72 to the
Euro and R18.75 to the Pound Sterling.

The JSE recorded a relatively mixed trading
session on Wednesday as it struggled for momentum ahead of the United States
Fed’s interest rate decision. The South African benchmark 10-year
Treasury yield pointed lower to reach a session low of 8.180% while the rand
traded mostly flat against the US dollar. US Treasuries also slipped along with other
major global Treasury bond yield benchmarks. With the US Fed expected to strike
a more dovish tone in its latest policy statement, yields are falling on the
back of bets that the Fed could cut rates at its next policy meeting in July. Initial estimates suggest that the Fed will
leave rates unchanged at 2.50% on Wednesday. Locally, Statistics SA released South
Africa’s inflation data for the month of May. CPI YoY was recorded at 4.5% which was

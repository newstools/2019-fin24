Global equity markets started the week off in the red as trade war concerns continued to wreak havoc across global markets. The new concerns arose after the “instigator in chief”, US President Donald Trump threatened to increase tariffs on Indian exports. The US want to remove the Asian nation from a special trade agreement from next week and India has in turn also threatened to impose sanctions on US goods, as relations between the Trump administration and the Modi government deteriorate. The trade agreement provides special exemptions to developing nations across the globe. There is a barrage of data points out this week, however the significance of these events may be reduced to mere announcements with no substance.  The market continues to be on edge as Trump aggressively fights on two fronts in his attempt to bolster domestic and foreign policy.

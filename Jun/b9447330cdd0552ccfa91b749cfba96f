In a week that saw the revival of a war of words over the expansion of the Reserve Bank's mandate, politicians ranging from ANC bigwigs to President Cyril Ramaphosa attempted to offer clarity on the matter. But this seemingly only served to increase confusion, taking its toll on the markets. Below are 7 stories that dominated headlines: On Tuesday, ANC secretary general Ace Magashule told reporters in Johannesburg that the party’s National Executive Committee resolved at the latest Lekgotla that the South African Reserve Bank’s mandate should be expanded, prompting a flurry of opposing views on the subject. Magashule’s comments opened a can of words from inside and outside the ANC. The governor of the Reserve Bank Lesetja Kganyago also came out swinging in defence of the institution. In a temporary respite from the Reserve Bank noise, Ramaphosa on Wednesday met with over 20 CEOs of state-owned companies to discuss challenges they faced. Ramaphosa said: On Thursday, Ramaphosa entered the Reserve Bank discourse in a bid to clarify the raging confusion, describing the political public spat by politicians as "not helpful". On Thursday, Kganyago intensified his rejection of the ANC's position likening the political imbroglio over the central bank to the arrival of the "barbarians at the gate of SARB". The week ended with the announcement of an interim SAA CEO, Zuks Ramasia, to take over from Vuyani Jarana who resigned from his job a week ago. Jarana quit after a year and a half on the job.

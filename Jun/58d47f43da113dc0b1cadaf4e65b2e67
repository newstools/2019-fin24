Steinhoff shares were changing hands at R1.37 shortly after markets opened on Wednesday, down from R1.50. The group's shares have fallen by over 90% since Jooste stepped down, cutting the multinational's market capitalisation by over R200bn. * Rand/euro conversions were calculated at an exchange rate of R16.26 to the euro.

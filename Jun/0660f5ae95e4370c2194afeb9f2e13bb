The 10-year bond yield fell back below 2.1% as weak private jobs data outweighed a report showing service industries beat estimates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed major gauges as Boeing surged after Bloomberg News reported the company has been negotiating one of the largest orders ever of wide-body jetliners with Chinese airlines.

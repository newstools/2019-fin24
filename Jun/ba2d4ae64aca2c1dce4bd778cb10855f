Zimbabwe has so far paid RTGS $53m to 737 white former farmers, mostly elderly and vulnerable, finance minister Mthuli Ncube said on Sunday. Minister Ncube added government is now working on a grand agreement that will culminate in an MOU and a structure to pay the compensation over 20/30 yrs. It is estimated the compensation bill could run into US$10bn. In year 2000, without compensation, Zimbabwe took over land from white commercial farmers and distributed it to landless blacks and also to the connected elite who now own multiple farms.

Saudi Arabia will begin implementing a new excise tax on sweetened drinks from December 1, according to the official gazette, as the kingdom seeks to boost non-oil revenue. The General Authority of Zakat and Tax is expanding a levy charged on tobacco and soda to include electronic cigarettes and all drinks with added sugar. Authorities have said the latter will be taxed at 50%.

Global equity markets took a breather on Wednesday after a
seven-day winning streak.  On Tuesday US
President Trump made it clear to the market that he held the cards to any
future US-Sino trade deals and that he was stalling the talks as he intends to
get “the best deal ever”.  Equity markets
have become very fickle and have jumped at any news that comes from President
Trumps Twitter account. What is certain in these markets is volatility is the
only constant and uncertainty reigns. Asian markets closed the day weaker today after protest
action in Hong Kong against the second reading of the expropriation bill.  The bill intends to lift the vail that
protects Hong Kong citizens from repressive Chinese legislation a caveat that
has been in place since the handover of Hong Kong back to mainland China in
1997. The Hang Seng retreated 1.73% whilst the Shanghai composite
eased 0.76%, loses were also recorded by the Nikkei and ASX 200 indices which
shed 0.35% and 0.04% respectively. Chinese Inflation numbers released this
morning indicated an uptick in inflation to 2.7% with food inflation increasing
by 1.6%, this inflation number has been the highest since November of 2018. The
increase in inflation provides the PBOC with more ammunition to inject more
stimulus in the market. The miners regained their shine on Wednesday as the Rand eased,
and commodity prices picked up. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd [JSE:ANG] advanced 6.77%

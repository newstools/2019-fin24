Business Leadership SA CEO Bonang Mohale will be stepping down after opting not to renew his contract. The organisation's current COO, Busisiwe Mavuso, will take up the reins, it said. Mohale took to social media networking website Twitter on Monday to announce that this week heralded his last week at the helm. Fin24 understands that Mohale’s exit was not a resignation in the strictest sense, but that Mohale's term had ended and the outgoing CEO was opting not to renew it. Mohale is understood to be pursuing other career ventures. Among other things, Mohale is the author of a newly released autobiographical book called Lift As You Rise.

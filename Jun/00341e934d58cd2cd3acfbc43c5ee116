South Africans will soon be experiencing their first
cannabis pizza range, following the recent announcement by the Department of
Health that cannabidiol may be legally purchased in SA. Italian-inspired restaurant franchise Col'Caccio has teamed
up with CBD brand africanpure to launch the first-ever cannabis pizza range,
the businesses said in a statement on Monday. The pizzas will be available at selected Col'Caccio restaurants
from 25 June, excluding the Windhoek and Halaal branches. It was recently announced that products containing CBD were
no longer scheduled, provided the maximum daily dose of CBD was under 20mg, and
as long as the product did not claim to cure or treat any specific condition. In the statement, Col'Caccio said it was cementing its
presence as an "innovative" restaurant brand, "with healthy dining being a key focus of their offering". "The brand was one of the
first to introduce gluten free, low calorie, Banting/ carb-conscious and vegan
alternatives to their menu and will now be the first restaurant brand to have a
Cannabis offering," the statement said. The Col’Cacchio menu will feature two gourmet Cannabis
inspired pizzas, namely the Green Goddess and the Not-So-Plain Mary Jane, retailed
at R125 and R140 respectively. The pizzas will be drizzled with africanpure CBD oil, which contains
no THC or synthetic chemicals, the statement said. Customers will also be able to add CBD oil to any other dish
on the Col’Cacchio menu at an additional cost of R25.

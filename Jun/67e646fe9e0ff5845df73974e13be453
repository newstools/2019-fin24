The South African government is considering a R3.2bn
guarantee for the country’s cash-strapped national broadcaster to help it raise
money from lenders, according to the Sunday Times. The broadcaster is saddled with large debts to the
municipality, signal distributors and Pay TV business Multichoice, the
newspaper reported, citing the chairman of SABC Bongumusa Makhathini. "We have also not maintained any of our infrastructure
and a communications blackout is imminent," Makhathini was quoted as
saying. The board is in the process of a "cleanup" including a number
of probes by the country’s Special Investigative Unit and an internal audit, he
said. The SABC is one of a number of state-owned companies in dire
need of financing, with power utility Eskom straining in a debt pile of over R400bn,
and South African Airways also needing to repay debts. The National Treasury is
being pressured to provide guarantees and bailouts to these businesses. The crises have come to a head following nine years of
alleged looting and mismanagement of government businesses under President
Jacob Zuma. Zuma denies any wrongdoing. The SABC’s chief auditing executive, Thami Zikode, recently
survived an alleged assassination attempt that Makhatini linked to the cleanup
at the broadcaster, where 180 people have been implicated in wrongdoings.

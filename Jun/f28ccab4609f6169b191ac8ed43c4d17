Multichoice CEO Calvo Mawela blamed the rise of new technologies for the company’s decision to lay off as
many as 2194 employees at the satellite television service provider. This comes after the company listing on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange and is an indication that Multichoice will look to make significant
adjustments to the customer service component of the business. Multichoice confirmed on Friday that it would lay of staff working
in the DStv operator’s customer care units. "This was not an easy decision, but as an undertaking that
is driven by advanced technology, we must be adaptable for our clients' needs
to ensure we remain relevant", said Mawela. Attack of the small screens: Africa eyes mobile gaming boom The Africa Games Week, in Cape Town, South Africa, looks at promoting the continent's video game industry, by bringing together developers and partners from both Africa and abroad. On Tuesday,

Demonstrations in Hong Kong were curbed on Thursday as anti-riot police
used rubber bullets and teargas to disperse of the protestors.  Calls of another protest on Sunday shook
markets in Asia as the prospects of a prolonged demonstration look likely. Year on year Gold
production for South Africa for the month of April declined by 19.5% which was
down from 18.3% in the month of March.  Mining
Production for the month of April declined by -2.3% in the month of April down
from 4.2% in the month of March. The weekly Jobs numbers out of the US surprised to the
downside on Thursday with initial jobless claims increasing to 222,000 new
claims whilst continuing claims increased to 1.695 million claims up 1.675
million the previous week.  These weaker
jobs numbers could provide more pressure for the FED to consider a rate cut
next week.  Export Prices in the US also
declined by 0.7%, which could be a result of Sino-US trade wars. The miners posted a second successive positive close on the JSE as

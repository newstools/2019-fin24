The rand plunged in early trade on Friday, a day after a public spat about the mandate of the SA Reserve Bank unsettled markets. The local currency opened at R14.99 and was trading at R15.10 to the greenback at 08:30, its lowest rate in eight months. TreasuryONE, in a note to clients on Friday morning, said the rand weakness was also caused by predictions by rating agency Moody's that the SA economy was likely to slip into a recession, and the ongoing trade war between the US and China. On Tuesday Stats SA announced that SA GDP growth shrank by 3.2% in the first three months of the year, the biggest drop in a decade. "Contradictory statements from the ANC regarding ownership of the Reserve Bank and what its mandate is also put the rand under pressure. President Ramaphosa affirmed the SARBâ€™s independence, but confirmed that ANC would like to [wholly nationalise] the SARB but could not afford to do it in the immediate future," said TreasuryONE.

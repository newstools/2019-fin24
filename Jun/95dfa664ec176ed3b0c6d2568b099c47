KPMG announced on Tuesday that former SAICA president Ignatius Sehoole had taken up his position as Chief Executive Officer at the firm, calling him an "experienced leader in the accounting profession". Sehoole was welcomed by KPMG SA chairman Wiseman Nkhulu, who said: "Ignatius will play a critical role in taking forward the renewal of KPMG following the far-reaching changes we have made over the past 18 months to enhance the quality of our work and address the challenges of the past. "We have already started to see recognition for the remedial efforts we have made, with our re-admittance to Business Leadership South Africa and SAVCA, re-appointment by many clients and securing new clients. But we know we have a way to go to rebuild trust in KPMG both internally and externally, and this will be a key focus area for Ignatius." Sehoole would continue to build on reforms that were already underway, Nkhulu said.

Finance Minister Tito Mboweni took to his Twitter account late on Friday to tweet a picture that had been circulating on social media of his face on a tin of Lucky Star pilchards. The image solicited hundreds of comments and retweets. Mboweni tweeted the words, "Who did this? You people are bad bad bad."  Mboweni has often taken to Twitter in recent months to demonstrate his cooking skills and has often also referenced the Lucky Star pilchards as a tried and tested meal option, again tweeting about it on Thursday.  The brand has also since caught on to Mboweni's love of its fish, regularly retweeting him. As far back as April, it tweeted Mboweni after he posted about the fish again during the ANC election campaign. Several Twitter users also started to refer to Mboweni as "Mr Lucky Star". The image of the tin with Mboweni's face garnered several comments from users, with some quipping that Lucky Star owed him a deal while others took Mboweni's comment on the picture and applied it to the fall of the rand and the recent ANC fallout over the mandate of the SA Reserve Bank.  Other companies have also since jumped on Mboweni's love of cooking, with Pick 'n Pay taking advantage of the Minister's recent tweet about his beef stew.

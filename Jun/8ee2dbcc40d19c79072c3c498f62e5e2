Standard Bank has made available a list of branches which
have been closed as the bank realigns its banking services. In March this year the Bank announced it would close 91
branches as the bank adopts a new banking delivery model. At the time, Standard
Bank said 1 200 jobs would be affected, Fin24 previously reported. As far back as November 2018 the bank had embarked on a
section 189 process, whereby 526 of its IT employees could opt for a
retrenchment package as the bank restructured its IT operating model. According to the lists of bank branches affected in each of
the nine provinces in SA, 104 branches were closed. The most, 49, were closed
in Gauteng. This is followed by the Western Cape (11) and Kwa-Zulu Natal (10)
and Northern Cape (9). Standard Bank spokesperson Ross Linstrom told Fin24 via email that the list of branches on its website were closed in 2018 and 2019. "Most of the branches impacted, additional to the information published by Standard Bank on March 14, 2019, were closed in 2018." The bank has said that digitised self-service banking channels will be available for customers.

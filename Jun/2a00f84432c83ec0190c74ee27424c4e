Eskom, through it's media desk, told Fin24 on Tuesday evening that it would consult with its legal advisors on how to effect a court order relating to nearly R600m that Trillian got from the power utility. Trillian Capital Partners was ordered pm Tuesday afternoon to pay back Eskom almost R595m by the High Court in Pretoria. Approached for comment, Eskom said it would need to refer to its legal team to map the way forward. "Eskom welcomes the judgement. We will be engaging with our legal advisors in the next few days to map the way forward and how to enforce the judgement," said an email from Eskom's media desk. The court ruled on Tuesday that payments from the state-owned power utility to Trillian were "unlawful and invalid". Eskom launched a bid to set aside the payments to global consultancy McKinsey and Trillian in March 2018. McKinsey apologised and paid back R902m to Eskom in early July 2018.

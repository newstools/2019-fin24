Transnet National Ports Authority on Wednesday afternoon got
a court interdict to stop a strike at its ports by South African Transport and
Allied Workers Union. The authority, which manages SA's eight commercial ports,
issued a statement on Wednesday evening indicating the countrywide strike
action had stopped. The union, Satawu, had given Transnet a 48-hour notice that marine
personnel would embark on strike action over salary discrepancies between black
and white mariners, Fin24 reported previously. "[...] White mariners draw higher salaries than their
black counterparts, even when they have less experience," said the union
in a media release," Satawu said in a statement on the strike. Satawu members who were involved in the strike include marine pilots, tug masters, and chief marine engineering officers responsible for operations in the port system, Transnet said. The company will continue to engage with the union to reach a resolution. "We would like to assure our customer and stakeholders of our commitment to provide a seamless service to the industry. TNPA management will be closely monitoring port operations and will try and prevent any potential disruptions to shipping movements," acting CEO Nozipho Mdawe said.

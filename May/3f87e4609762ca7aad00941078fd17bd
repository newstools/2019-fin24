The Comair board announced on Wednesday that aviation sector veterans Glenn Orsmond and Wrenelle Stander will take over as joint CEOs from July 31, 2019. Comair operates under its low-fare airline brand, kulula.com, as well as under the British Airways livery, as part of a license agreement. Stander will serve as Joint CEO: Airlines. Orsmond will serve as Joint CEO: Non-Airline Business and Financial Services. The announcement follows Erik Venter's resignation last week. He leaves the company at the end of July. Stander is currently executive director of Comair's airline division. Orsmond, a chartered accountant, was Comair's financial director for eight years from 1995 to 2003. Board chair Piet van Hoven said in a statement on Wednesday that the new CEOs' task will be to optimise the airline's business performance whilst also building on the diversification strategy that has been central to the group's growth in stagnant market conditions. "The group is less reliant on the notoriously volatile airline businesses, which are so dependent on the performance of the broader economy. These other businesses now contribute 30% of profit," said Van Hoven. Comair’s diversified portfolio covers brands in the airline, tourism and hospitality industries, a training academy with a global customer base, as well as a business providing technology support and solutions for the tourism, travel and aviation sectors.

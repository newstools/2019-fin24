Beyond Meat just got its first sell-side bull after its splashy IPO last week. The stock, up 
more than 200% since its trading debut last week, was rated a new
 outperform at Bernstein, and analyst Alexia Howard sees even more 
upside, albeit much smaller than its recent gains. Her price target of 
$81 implies an 5% appreciation from the stock’s current price. “Recent and planned expansions in production capacity look set to 
facilitate rapid sales growth in 2019 and beyond,” Howard wrote, 
estimating that if the alternative meat category follows the same growth
 path as plant-based beverages, the total addressable market could reach
 about $40.5bn in the US over the next decade. Beyond Meat, which had the 
strongest first day for an IPO since at least 2008, added another 6.4% on Tuesday, rising to $79.56 in early trading. While the company is facing competition from the likes of Impossible 
Foods, rising consumer demand should allow multiple brands to share the 
market, Howard wrote. What’s more, the African swine fever outbreak in 
China could drive up global meat prices, making plant-based burgers look
 more attractive, she added. Other Wall Street analysts will be able to weigh in on the stock 
after research restrictions expire on May 28. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, 
Credit Suisse, BofAML, Jefferies and William Blair are among banks that 
managed the company’s initial public offering who may publish research 
after the quiet period ends.

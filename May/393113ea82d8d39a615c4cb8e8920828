Royal Dutch Shell is planning to acquire an oil-block stake
in a second deal in South Africa’s relatively unexplored waters, months after a
major discovery by Total SA boosted the country’s hydrocarbon prospects. Shell has applied to take a stake in a license owned by OK
Energy, located in deep waters off South Africa’s west coast, according to
Petroleum Agency South Africa. "We have indeed received an application
which is awaiting ministerial approval," the regulator said in a reply to
questions about the block. The Anglo-Dutch major exited its Orange Basin permit two
years ago, citing an enduring low-price environment. It also complained at the
time of uncertainty over resource laws in South Africa. The country recently
pledged to draft separate legislation for oil and gas. Shell declined to comment. Should the deal for OK Energy’s
license go through, it would add to the company’s acquisition of a 40% interest
in deep-water blocks 5, 6 and 7 in the Atlantic off Cape Town from Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. In February, Total discovered an estimated 1 billion barrels
of oil equivalent east of Anadarko’s blocks, where the oceans meet at the tip
of the continent. South Africa’s first deep-water find was described as "catalytic"
for the country by South African Oil & Gas Alliance, an industry lobby
group. Besides the block Shell is interested in, OK Energy, a small
oil and gas company, also holds a 10% stake in another area with Equinor ASA
off South Africa’s east coast.

Want to get a fish eye’s view of the Great Barrier Reef but
don’t have a boat? Ride-share company Uber announced on Thursday that it’s
launching a new feature called ScUber, allowing customers to book a submarine
trip through the Uber app in Queensland, Australia. The ScUber experience will be available from May 27 to June
18, initially from Heron Island off the coast of Gladstone in the Southern
Great Barrier Reef region, and then from the coast of Port Douglas in Cairns,
from June 9 until June 18. For 3 000 Australian dollars (about R29 000), the experience
includes being picked up from, and dropped off at, your location via the Uber
app, then a helicopter ride to the launch point (either Heron Island or Port
Douglas), a one-hour ride in the ScUber submarine, and a half-day of snorkeling
and touring the Great Barrier Reef. The submarine service is designed to support the protection
of the coral reef system through Uber’s new partnership with the organisation
Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef. Uber is no stranger to nontraditional marketing stunts,
having previously ventured into ice cream delivery and a service called
UberKittens, which allowed customers to request a playdate with kittens to
support the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The
company is also working to develop a flying taxi via a partnership with Aurora
Flight Sciences. The submarine offering comes after Uber’s initial public
offering flop on May 11; shares plunged immediately after trading opened and
fell as much as 8.8% from its IPO price of $45 per share by the end of its
first day. The stock price is down about 10% from the IPO figure amid flareups
in US-China trade negotiations and the recent dismal performance of rival Lyft.

Tsogo Sun, which is in the process of unbundling its hotel interests, has announced that it intends to list the holding company – THL – on June 12.

Following the unbundling, Tsogo Sun will be comprised of its gaming division – casino and alternative gaming operations. The plan is to change the name of Tsogo Sun to Tsogo Sun Gaming, Fin24 previously reported. The hotel part of casino complexes will be owned by the group and remain Tsogo Sun, it will be operated under a management agreement by THL, the group previously explained.

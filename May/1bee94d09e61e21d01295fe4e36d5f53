Pop star Rihanna is joining French luxury conglomerate LVMH to launch a new fashion house under her Fenty brand, selling ready-to-wear clothing, shoes and accessories. The Paris-based label will make its debut this spring, LVMH said in a statement confirming earlier reports on the plans. Rihanna joins other singers, like Beyonce, in developing their own fashion lines to capitalise on Instagram-fuelled celebrity buzz that’s driving the industry’s sales.

The agreement links one of the biggest cultural influencers with the world’s largest luxury conglomerate - led by the world’s third-richest person, with an $88bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault “has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits,” said Rihanna, whose surname is Fenty. big day for the culture. thank you Mr.Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH .

The JSE closed lower for a second
consecutive session as blue-chips remained subdued mainly on the back of
negative sentiment across most global indices. Traders and investors continued to exercise
caution as they try to assess the potential impacts of the higher tariffs that
Donald Trump has threatened on China. Market participants expect the China to
retaliate if the US goes ahead with the tariff increase and more importantly it
could take longer than expected until a trade deal is reached. Locally, markets
were also tentative ahead of the South Africa general elections which are
taking place on Wednesday. Despite the recovery in China and Hong Kong on Tuesday
the trend remained mostly weaker across Europe and the USA. The rand recouped marginally from its

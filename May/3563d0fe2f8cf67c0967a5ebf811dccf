The JSE inched higher on Thursday, mainly on the back of gains that were recorded in the financials and industrials indices. Global markets digested the US Fed's decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 2.50%, as the Fed chair highlighted the committee's confidence at the current inflation rate as well as its focus on household spending and business investment.   The Bank of England also decided to leave interest rates unchanged in a decision that was announced on Thursday, and perhaps more importantly, the bank decided to keep its current asset purchase programme unchanged. The US will be in the spotlight again on Friday as we expect the release of the all-important Non-Farm Payrolls numbers for the month of April. As expected, the US dollar was volatile on Wednesday before the US Fed's rate decision and press conference. After the decision, the greenback managed to close the session firmer and this trend continued into Thursday as it advanced further. The rand came under pressure as a result as it fell to a session low of R14.54/$. At 17:00 CAT, the rand was trading 0.66% weaker at R14.54/$. This was despite an improvement in the Absa Manufacturing PMI numbers for April, which improved to 47.2 from a prior recording of 45.0. On the JSE, EOH Holdings [JSE:EOH] had a stellar day as it jumped 17.24% to end the day at R23.94. Hospitality group Tsogo Sun Holdings [JSE:TSH] managed to gain 4.55% as it closed at R22.50, while its sector peer Sun International [JSE:SUI] climbed 7.92% to end the day at R59.24.

The Health Professions Council of SA on Friday said it welcomed the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa that he had referred a probe into the council to the Special Investigating Unit. In a notice in the government gazette, the president said the unit had been tasked with investigating maladministration and the unlawful registration of health practitioners by the council. The HPCSA regulates the registration, training and ethical behaviour of health practitioners in South Africa. All health care professionals must register with the council.   In a statement on Friday afternoon the council's registrar and CEO, Dr Raymond Billa, said the HPCSA had itself in August 2018 submitted a request to the SIU to investigate allegations of maladministration and corruption linked to registration, training and evaluation of health practitioners. This followed the release of an earlier investigation by Heath Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi in October 2015, which called for several officials to be sacked.

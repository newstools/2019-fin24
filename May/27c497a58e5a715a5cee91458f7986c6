Ayo Technology Solutions Chief Investment Officer Abdul Malick Salie has resigned as an executive director with immediate effect, the company announced on Tuesday evening. He is doing so for personal reasons, Ayo said in a statement. Although the notice was issued on Tuesday May 7, the resignation was already effective from May 6. "Malick will, however, remain as an employee of Ayo in a senior management role and will continue to oversee all of the company's investment activities. Hence there will be no disruption to any of Ayo's current investment functions or opportunities," Ayo added. "The Board takes this opportunity to express their appreciation to Malick and extends its best wishes for his future endeavours." Salie is a Chartered Accountant (CA) who has served on a number of boards. In recent months, his name has cropped up in news reports documenting the commission of inquiry into allegations of impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation.

The JSE traded mostly flat on Monday before closing firmer as investors looked for fresh signals on market direction. Following last week’s slump, the tone remains cautious across most global indices with gains being relatively modest. Markets in the US and the United Kingdom were closed on Monday which also added to the relatively subdued trading activity across global indices. The trade war between China and the US remains a thorn in the flesh of most investors and inevitably this will remain the talking point in the short to medium term.

Stocks tumbled worldwide on Monday after
Donald Trump threatened to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to the USA over
the weekend. Investors scurried to safety as doubts were
cast over the possibility of an amicable deal being reached in talks that were
scheduled to begin this week. This nullified the impact of the improved US jobs
data which was released on Friday. With Chinese trade data set to be released
on Tuesday, there could be more downside if the numbers fail to beat initial
estimates. Earlier in Asian markets trading the
Shanghai Composite Index slumped 5.84% while the Hang Seng lost 2.9%. The
Nikkei only lost 0.22%. All the major indices in Europe were trading lower
while US markets also opened significantly lower. On the currency market, emerging market
currencies retreated as the Chinese yuan came under pressure. The rand fell to
a session low of R14.53/$ before it was recorded trading 1.12% weaker at
R14.50/$ at 17.00 CAT. Naspers [JSE:NPN] led the local bourse
lower after its associate Tencent Holdings closed 3.15% weaker on the Hang
Seng. This resulted in Naspers closing 3.31% lower at R3599.01. Rand sensitives
pulled back due to the weaker rand which saw retailers such as Massmart
[JSE:MSM] drop 3.3% to close at R91.14, while the Pick n Pay [JSE:PIK] lost
1.32% to end the day at R69.42. Banker, ABSA Group [JSE:ABG] lost 2.6% as it

after the JSE close.

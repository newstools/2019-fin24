SARS says it will extend the deadline for a tender aimed at securing a service provider to help curb the illicit tobacco trade. The revenue service issued a statement on the update about the tender on Friday. SARS had announced the tender in April, with a deadline for June 20. "The extension allows the Commissioner, Mr Edward Kieswetter the opportunity to apply his mind, consider all relevant factors and consult further," the statement read. "Further details will be provided in due course through the normal procurement process including the extension period," SARS said. SARS intends to use "track-and-trace marker technology" to help monitor the movement of cigarettes from production facilities to points of sale, Fin24 reported previously. The Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa and the Fair-Trade Independent Tobacco Association, which represent various players in the industry, have welcomed the move by SARS to institute tighter controls.

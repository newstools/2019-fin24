Business Unity South Africa has called on the new government to announce a "compact and capable" Cabinet to help address the country's economic challenges. On Saturday the Electoral Commission of SA announced that the ANC had won 57.5% of Wednesday's general election, with the DA in second place with 20.77% and the EFF third with 10.79%. The ANC will again have a clear majority of members of the National Assembly. "An aligned, focused, compact and capable cabinet will enable speedier decision making and implementation to address the country’s economic challenges," the private sector business federation said in a statement on Sunday. "Cabinet ministers, directors-general and other key staff in the economic and justice clusters need to be appointed on the basis of competence, capability, experience and integrity." According to economist Mike Schüssler, recent economic data suggests SA's economy shrunk in the first quarter of 2019, with a predicted fall in growth of between 1.2% and 2.2%. BUSA said that capable senior staff would be critical to oversee the country's economic turnaround and ensure justice is served in the quest to combat corruption. Before the final election results were announced, the ANC said it would give President Cyril Ramaphosa its full backing to reduce the size of the Cabinet.

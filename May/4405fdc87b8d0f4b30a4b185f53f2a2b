The JSE rebounded to close firmer on Friday
as it was buoyed by the firmer close recorded in Chinese markets. Chinese markets rose despite the
implementation of the tariff hike on $US200bn worth of Chinese goods on
Friday. China is widely expected to retaliate to these tariffs, but no
specified action has been detailed yet. It has been a rough week for global
stocks since Donald Trump made his intent about the tariff hike known. In
China, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 3.63% while in Hong Kong the Hang Seng
managed to gain 0.84%. Although this relief might be temporary, European
markets also managed to rise on the back of that sentiment. US equity futures
on the other hand remained subdued, which eventually saw US markets open
weaker. Locally the rand rallied along with other
emerging market currencies mainly on the back of the weaker US dollar. The rand
gained over a percent against the greenback as it peaked at R14.17/$, before
retracing to trade 0.93% firmer at R14.21/$ at 17.00 CAT. On the JSE, financials led the gains mainly
on the back of the stronger rand. Standard Bank [JSE:SBK] gained 4.08% to close

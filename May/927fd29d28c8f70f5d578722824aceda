The Competition
Commission has recommended to the Competition Tribunal that a proposed merger –
which will see Capitec acquiring Mercantile Bank Holdings Limited – should be
approved without conditions. The
Commission found that the proposed transaction was unlikely to result in a
substantial prevention or lessening of competition in the relevant markets. It
further found that the proposed transaction did not raise any public interest
concerns, it said in a statement on Friday. The
Portuguese Council of Ministers in November announced its approval of the sale
by Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD) of its entire stake in Mercantile Bank
to Capitec, Fin24
previously reported. CGD,
which owned 100% of Mercantile, sold the bank as part of a strategic
recapitalisation plan approved by the European Commission, requiring CGD to
reduce its foreign assets.

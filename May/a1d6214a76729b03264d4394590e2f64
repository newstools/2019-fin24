The Federation of Unions of South
Africa (Fedusa) is calling on Tiso Blackstar Group [JSE:TBG] to halt retrenchment proceedings amid ongoing consultations with affiliate, the
South African Typographical Union (SATU). The federation is of the view that continuing with the retrenchments is in flagrant breach of discussions that were instituted in terms of
Section 189A of the Labour Relations Act with SATU. Fedusa said that during consultations,
management has not demonstrated any sensitivity towards the plight of
workers threatened with the loss of their jobs. "The insensitive determination to
proceed with these retrenchments flies in the face of clear commitments to save
jobs, made by both government and the private sector at the Presidential Jobs
Summit in October last year," said Fedusa acting general secretary Riefdah Ajam in statement. "Furthermore, Tiso Blackstar is
violating our affiliate’s organisational rights by threatening to stop
processing members’ subscriptions." Tiso Blackstar is currently in the process of section 189 process in terms of the Labour Relations Act, which allows employers to dismiss employees in order to keep operations going in a sustainable manner. According to the Labour Relations Act, the subscription amount payable by the members a union can be calculated as a percentage of an employee's salary or, if there are two or more registered trade unions party to the agreement, the highest amount of the subscription that would apply to an employee. SATU general secretary Edward De Klerk it is a matter of great concern that Tiso Blackstar seemed determined to condemn workers to the rank of the
jobless in the context of extremely high levels of unemployment and slow economic growth in the
country. Tiso Blackstar is home to award-winning publications such as the Sunday Times, Business Day and Financial Mail.

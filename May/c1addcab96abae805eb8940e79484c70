The rand will likely continue to take its cue from the
US/China trade war this week, as talks between the world's two largest
economies remain deadlocked over tariffs, according to analysts. "In spite of last week’s election and a perceived
investor-friendly outcome, the rand has been largely driven by international
factors with the election contributing only marginally to its direction,"
said Bianca Botes of Peregrine Treasury Solutions in an update to clients on Monday
morning.    The local currency, which strengthened on Friday, lost some
ground on Monday morning. At 08:15 it was changing hands at R14.24 to the greenback. Analysts have predicted that the rand may start to strengthen
after the ANC won its six consecutive general election with 57.5% on the vote.
This gives the ruling party a clear majority in the National Assembly. But international events have introduced risk into foreign exchange markets. "On the market risks rather than convictions have to be translated into prices. And one thing has become clear over the past days and weeks: that quite a lot can go wrong in this negotiating process," said Commerzbank in note. "Moreover the most impressive current news flow consists of the US President’s tweets. And if one reads those one is overcome by concerns that the moment when all bridges have been burned and constructive talks are no longer possible cannot be far off."

Evidence presented at the state capture inquiry on Thursday
shifted to procurement processes at Transnet, which have been identified by the
new board as being at the heart of financial flows of the state-run
freight rail company. Peter Volmink, Transnet's executive head of governance, told
the commission that procurement since 2016 had been "something of an
aberration". The inquiry is investigating allegations of state capture,
corruption and fraud. "There were certain individuals who were granted the
power to award tenders," said Volmink. He added that the awarding of
contracts should have been overseen by an acquisition council, with legal,
compliance and risk factors considered. He told the inquiry that Transnet's
current procurement rules, however, were not clearly written. This led to
differing interpretations of the regulations. According to Volmink, changes in the Transnet procurement
system saw the awarding of tenders being shifted from the acquisition council
to individuals such as the chief supply chain officer and chief financial
officer. 'A clear breach' The chief supply chain officer was given the power of an
acquisition council for contracts of up to R50m, while the chief financial
officer had the power to adjudicate contracts of up to a billion rand, acting
as an acquisition council. "That person was the adjudication committee," said
Volmink. Volmink also said that some of Transnet's contracts with
global consultancy McKinsey were awarded under abnormal circumstances. "The
letters of award were issued while the tender process was still underway. This
is a clear breach." 'Architects of
capture' On Tuesday, Transnet chairperson Popo Molefe described the
former top Transnet executives Brian Molefe, Siyabonga Gama and Anoj Singh as
the "architects of capture". He said these executives had signed off on large and
irregular contracts, flouting procurement processes to "facilitate the
entry of companies which were their darlings".

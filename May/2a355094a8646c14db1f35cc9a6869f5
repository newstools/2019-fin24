expectations of the new dawn mantra he based his election campaign on. In this
morning trade, the local bourse rallied in unison with international markets. Africa’s largest diversified packaging group Nampak [JSE:NPK] released
results first half results, this morning. The packaging giant has found the

growth and repatriation of dividends to South Africa. These headwinds saw
revenues decline by 4% and trading profit declined by 18%. Inflation from the factory gate - Producer Price Inflation increased to 6.5% in the month of April up from 6.2%, this number was the highest recorded in 2019 and the highest since November of 2018.

This increase in inflation indicates that prices increased at a faster pace than had been anticipated.  Gains were recorded by SA Inc shares on the day with banks,

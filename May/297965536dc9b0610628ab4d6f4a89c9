MTN Group's
Nigerian unit plans to raise about R8bn this year from a variety of sources
including bank loans and bonds to expand operations in its biggest market. The funds
will enable Africa’s largest wireless carrier to finance capital expenditure to
increase the reach and efficiency of its network in Nigeria, Chief Financial
Officer Adekunle Awobodu said by phone from Lagos. MTN has also started the
process of listing its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The company
had announced plans to raise as much as 400 billion naira (about R15bn) last
year, and later signed to a 200 billion naira (about R8bn) credit line with a
group of banks. MTN is "currently arranging" for another 200 billion
naira, according to Awobodu. It
registered 20.35 billion ordinary shares with the country’s Securities and
Exchange Commission last week, with about 20% expected to be listed on the
Lagos bourse this week. MTN has 65.6 million subscribers in Nigeria, or 38% of
the market, according to February data provided by the Nigerian Communications
Commission.

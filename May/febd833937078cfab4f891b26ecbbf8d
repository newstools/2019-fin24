The JSE retreated on Friday as it took a
leaf from Chinese markets which fell after Chinese state media highlighted that
was little interest in resuming trade talks with the USA. The impact of this new information was
evident on the Shanghai Composite Index which fell 2.54%, while the Hang Seng
lost 1.16%. Stocks in Japan advanced which saw the Nikkei close 0.89% firmer. In Europe, the trend remained mostly lower
while a mixed picture ensued for the USA’s major indices. With both the USA and China trying to force
each other’s hand in the trade negotiations, investors are increasingly
becoming concerned that a deal will not be reached soon which leaves a lot of
uncertainty for the financial markets.

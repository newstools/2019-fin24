Transpaco CEO Phillip Abelheim on Wednesday denied accusations from the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa that the company forced workers to clock in on Election Day. Abelheim dismissed the claims as "an outright fabrication". On Wednesday, millions of South Africans reported to their respective voting stations to cast their vote and elect new national and provincial governments. The day was declared a public holiday, allowing all citizens of age with an ID book or smart card to vote. Numsa released a statement on Election Day, condemning Transpaco for "forcing workers to work on Election Day". The union said its regional officials in Johannesburg had learned that Transpaco employees complained of dismissal threats if they failed to report for duty on Election Day. Numsa regional secretary Oupa Ralaka told Fin24 that they were acting on the basis of what they heard from the workers themselves. However, Ralaka said, Abelheim denied the allegations in his communication with the union. Abelheim told Fin24 that Transpaco never threatened to dismiss workers that stayed away from work to vote. He said the company’s facilities would be closed during the time that voting stations were open. "It is an outright lie. The union has been doing this for a long time. We have just come from a strike which lasted for three months. It is not true that we have done this. Our factories are closed," Abelheim said. Transpaco managing director Jaco Breytenbach said circulars had been up at the business since Monday, saying business would be closed until late Wednesday night.

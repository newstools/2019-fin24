The JSE closed weaker on Wednesday led by moderate losses across most blue-chip stocks. Trade tensions remain the dominant driver of market direction globally and as of Wednesday, most global indices retreated as the US threatened to target more Chinese technology firms.  In the United Kingdom, the pound sterling fell as pressure mounts on prime minister Theresa May to quit following her offer for a second referendum. Locally, Statistics SA released South Africa's inflation readings for the month of April. Inflation year-on-year (y/y) slowed down to 4.4% from a prior recording of 4.5%, while inflation month-on-month (M/M) was recorded at 0.6% which was better than the forecasted 0.8%.

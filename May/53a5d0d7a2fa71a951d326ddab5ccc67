Following its popular Little Shop and Little Garden promotions, where shoppers could collect various related items, Checkers has now launched a Little Checkers promotion. For as long as stocks last, Checkers and Checkers Hyper shoppers will be rewarded with a free block pack for every R200 spent in store. Each Block pack contains a unit that forms part of a mini Checkers supermarket. Once all 35 available packs have been collected, consumers can build an entire Little Checkers store. According to Checkers, the blocks come in a 100% recyclable pack and each contains one individual unit - such as a mini till, freezer, shopping cart, dairy shelf and more - as well as stickers to complete the unit and an instruction leaflet. 'It's become our thing' "Following the success of Little Shop and Little Garden, it is safe to say that innovative and educational collectables have become our thing," commented Willie Peters, general manager: marketing at Checkers. "These are functional, re-usable toys." It is expected that, as with its Little Shop and Little Garden collectables, Little Checkers will be collected by adults (including teachers and educational therapists) and children alike. Starter kits and delivery trucks will be sold separately at R79.99 and R69.99 respectively.

Hilton Hotels has announced the signing of a management agreement with Growthpoint Properties, South Africa's largest real estate investment trust (REIT), to open a hotel under its lifestyle Canopy by Hilton brand. The 150 guestroom Canopy by Hilton Cape Town Longkloof is expected to open in 2021 and will be the brand's debut property in Africa. It will be located at Long Kloof Studios on the corner of Park Road and Kloof Street. According to a statement, Canopy by Hilton launched in 2014 to appeal to travellers "seeking locally inspired stays and wishing to immerse themselves in the culture and history of local neighbourhoods". It currently operates in nine destinations around the world with more than 35 properties in the pipeline. Located close to the historical Company's Garden, the project forms part of a precinct redevelopment by Growthpoint, representing a R550m investment in the city. Rudolf Pienaar, chief development and investment officer of Growthpoint Properties, said the investment reflects its confidence in Cape Town as well as Hilton's exceptional upscale lifestyle hotel brand. According to Patrick Fitzgibbon, senior vice president, development for Hilton in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said Cape Town is one of the world's most sought-after destinations, offering an array of attractions to suit every travel occasion. "Canopy by Hilton becomes our third brand to gain a presence in the city and we are eyeing further expansion. The decision to locate Africa's first Canopy by Hilton here, is testament to not only the strength of the destination, but the quality of partners at Growthpoint, as we seek to create a showcase interpretation of the brand to introduce to the African continent," he said.

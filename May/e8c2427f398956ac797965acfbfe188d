Vodacom announced on Monday morning that its revenue and operating costs increased, but net profit fell marginally, in the year ended March 31, 2019. Operating profit rose 1.1% to R24.51bn, while net profit declined by 0.8% to R15.44bn. Headline earning per share dropped 6.6% from 923 cents to 862 cents. In a statement Vodacom's Group CEO Shameel Joosub said that a reduction in out-of-bundle tariffs had contributed to a 37% decline in effective data prices since the end of March 2018. This, together with costs associated with the group's new R16.4bn BEE ownership deal, dampened growth in Vodacomâ€™s operating profit. The mobile operator added 6 million customers in the year ended March 31. It now has a total of 110 million customers across the group. Joosub said the group saw excellent results in its international operations, including an increase in service revenue of 15.6% and 25.8% growth in data revenue. The group announced a dividend of R7.95 per share, down 2.5% from the previous year.

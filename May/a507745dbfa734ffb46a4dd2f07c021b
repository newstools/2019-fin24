A strong contingent of South African business events, conferencing and meetings products will be on display for the next three days at one of the world's premier Meetings, Incentives, Conference and Events (MICE) exhibition shows, IMEX Frankfurt. The annual IMEX Frankfurt show will see over 3 500 products in the exhibition halls while around 5 100 buyers will walk the floors in search of great deals and unique products in this sector of the tourism industry.  South Africa has representation across the board from hotels, airlines, destination management companies, provincial tourism agencies, provincial convention bureaus, professional conference organisers as well as selected SMME’s from South African Tourism’s and the National Department of Tourism’s Hidden Gem's programme. These products will be hosted on the South African National Convention Bureau's stand. "South Africa over the recent years has consistently been ranked as the top African country in the ICCA rankings which is the global community and knowledge hub for the international association meetings industry," says Amanda Kotze-Nhlapo, Chief Convention Bureau Officer at SA Tourism. “For South Africa, the business events sector has an extensive value chain, stimulating economic activity in manufacturing, in the services sector and in the creative and cultural industries." Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency (ECPTA) is one of the provincial tourism agencies exhibiting and they are attending IMEX Frankfurt for the first time. There are four exhibitors from the Hidden Gems programme – Makgale Tours (Gauteng); Urban Ginga (Gauteng); Crystal Productions (Western Cape) and Adventure Works (Western Cape) – attending the show. With transformation in the tourism industry a focal point for the South African tourism industry, the IMEX Frankfurt platform is seen as an ideal opportunity for the SMME's to showcase the diverse and unique offerings to a large audience.

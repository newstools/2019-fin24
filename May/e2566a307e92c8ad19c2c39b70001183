The JSE retreated to close weaker on Friday as it tracked
other major global indices lower. The moves lower across most equity markets were triggered by
Donald Trump’s threat for increased tariffs against Mexico in retaliation to
the influx of immigrants into the US from Mexico. The US is already in a
full-fledged trade war with China, and this latest development with Mexico
raises more concerns for investors who are struggling to fully comprehend the
impact of that trade war with China. In Japan the Nikkei fell 1.63%, in Hong Kong the Hang Seng
lost 0.79% while in mainland China the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.31%. In
Europe all the major indices were down by more than 1% on average while the US’s
major indices opened considerably lower. The rand managed to recoup some of the losses that it has
taken over the past couple of sessions as it advanced on Friday. The strength
in the rand was mainly due to the weakness that was recorded in the greenback
as indicated by the US dollar index which traded marginally softer. The rand
had peaked at a session high of R14.53/$ before it was recorded trading 1.09%
firmer at R14.56/$ at 17:00. On the JSE, Tongaat Hulett [JSE:TON] came under significant
pressure following the release of a strategic and financial review, in which
the company stated that the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018
would need to be restated. The stock fell 7.73% to close at R16.70. EOH Holdings [JSE:EOH] also struggled on the day as it fell 7.23%
to close at R19.25, while cement maker PPC [JSE:PPC] dropped 3.04% to close at
R4.79. Losses on the resources index were led by diversified mining giant Anglo
America [JSE:AGL] which lost 2.68% to close at R348.15, while Kumba Iron Ore
[JSE:KIO] fell 2.82% to close at R442.04. Oil and gas producer Sasol [JSE:SOL] closed 3.02% weaker at
R366.59, while commodity trading giant Glencore [JSE:GLN] closed at R46.63
after losing 3.22%. Mr Price [JSE:MRP] surged on the back of the release of its
full-year results which showed positive growth in revenue and profitability.
The stock eventually closed 11% firmer at R197.15. Massmart Holdings [JSE:MSM]
also got a lift as it climbed 5.81% to end the day at R67.35, while Pick n Pay
[JSE:PIK] gained 2.4% to close at R70.97. Gold miner AngloGold Ashanti [JSE:ANG] rose 8.27% to close

blue-chip JSE Top-40 index lost 0.39%. The resources index fell 1.42%, while
the financials and industrials indices barely closed firmer as they added 0.27%
and 0.02% respectively. Brent crude weakened significantly because of Trump’s tariff
threats against Mexico. The commodity was trading 2.62% weaker at R63.62/barrel. At 17:00, gold was up 1.09% at $1302.49/Oz, platinum was
0.36% weaker at $793.20/Oz, and palladium had lost 1.97% to trade at

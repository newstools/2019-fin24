Eskom is not planning to institute rotational load shedding on Monday due to a drop in electricity demand over the holiday season and the return of some generating units to service. In a power status update on Monday morning, the utility said it would continue to use emergency reserves to supplement capacity if
necessary. "We however remind customers that as the system
continues to be vulnerable and unpredictable, the possibility of load shedding
remains." Eskom said that unplanned breakdowns were at 13 729MW at 06:30 on Monday morning, still well above the level of 9 500MW it is aiming for.   "Our technical teams will continue to work over the holiday period
to monitor the situation, carry out planned maintenance and to work at reducing
unplanned breakdowns to below 9 500MW to enable us to minimise the
possibility of load shedding," it said.

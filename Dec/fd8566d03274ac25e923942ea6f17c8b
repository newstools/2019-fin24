It is estimated 360 000 days per year are wasted annually on redundant cargo handling audits. That is why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has recently launched a new programme to raise global standards in cargo handling operations. The Smart Facility Operational Capacity (SFOC) programme aims to reduce audit complexity and duplication for cargo handling facilities. Airlines participating in the SFOC programme will undertake a gap analysis to determine which audit standards will not need to be assessed for SFOC certified facilities. The revised audit scope is then defined through the Audit Reduction Commitment (ARC). Individual airlines will provide clear visibility on the potential audit reduction for SFOC certified facilities, ensuring there is a solid mechanism to eliminate redundant audits. "Auditing is critical to ensure the global standards that underpin the safe and efficient operations in the aviation industry. IATA's strong capabilities in auditing have been proven in the successful IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) and CEIV programmes. The SFOC programme will bring this expertise to general cargo handling operations," says Glyn Hughes, IATA's Global head of cargo. SATS is the first Cargo Handling Facility to receive the new SFOC Audit Certification and Singapore Airlines is the first airline to join the programme by signing the ARC. * Compiled by Carin Smith

African Equity Empowerment Investments (AEEI) said in a trading update on Wednesday evening that a reasonable degree of certainty exists that its financial results for the period to be reported on next will vary by 20% or more when compared to those of the prior reporting period. During the year, the group regained control over its investment in AYO Technology Solutions (AYO) and the group, therefore, incurred a once-off accounting loss on a deemed disposal of an associate.

The company also expects that the group's headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the year ended 31 August 2019 will be between 111.74 cents and 116.58 cents per share, compared to 24.24 cents in the prior corresponding year, representing an increase of between 361% and 381%. The company further expects that the group's normalised headline earnings per share for the year ended 31 August 2019, will be between 118.63 cents and 123.65 cents per share, compared to the 25.09 cents in the prior corresponding period, representing an increase of between 373% and 393%.

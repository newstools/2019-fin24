One of the most common scams is tech support fraud, where someone pretends to call from your bank or a company saying that your account has been hijacked and needs your help to take control of it. There is also the "one ring scam" where an unknown number (usually an international number) gives you a missed call and when you call them back you get charged a hefty fee for calling to that number. The "job offer scam" is where someone pretends to be a head-hunter calling you to offer you a job, but you need to pay a fee in order to get the job. In its 2018 report, Truecaller found that fewer African markets were in the Top 20 compared to the previous year. South Africa was the only country in the list, it noted - with the number of spam calls increasing by 40%.    * Compiled by Carin Smith

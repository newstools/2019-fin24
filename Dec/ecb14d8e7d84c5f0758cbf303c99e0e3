The local bourse closed softer on Thursday
on the back of broad-based losses across all the major indices. Although the losses were modest, this
weakness persisted for the duration of today’s session. This contrasted with
the trend in global markets where stocks continued to ride the trade optimism
which arose on Wednesday, on the back of hints that the USA would not hike
tariffs on China at the next deadline of 15 December. Economic data out of
South Africa, and more importantly GDP numbers were disappointing this week,
which is also a factor which has added to the current pessimism on the local
market. The rand weakened against the greenback
despite the US dollar trading softer against a basket of major currencies. The
rand bottomed out at a session low of R14.69/$ before it was recorded trading 0.46%
weaker at R14.65/$ at 17.00 CAT. On the JSE, Glencore [JSE:GLN] grabbed

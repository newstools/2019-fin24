The Dogon Group says it secured a single holiday rental of just under R1m for a four-night stay on the Atlantic Seaboard. The agency also made a short-term rental deal of R220 000 per month for a house in Bantry Bay. In the suburb of Constantia it concluded a lease of R450 000 per month on a security estate. Janine Sullivan, Pam Golding Properties rental agent (holiday and long-term rentals) for Camps Bay, says the most expensive properties are the "villa hotel" style accommodation that come with a chef who prepares all meals, a butler service, a property manager, a daily cleaning service and a snack bar. She says the least expensive rental in this area is R2 500 a night and rentals go up to R180 000 a night. Seeff, meanwhile, says it concluded rentals of up to R170 000 per month in Fresnaye, R130 000 per month at the V&A Waterfront, R120 000 per month in Bantry Bay and R60 000 per month in Tamboerskloof in the City Bowl.

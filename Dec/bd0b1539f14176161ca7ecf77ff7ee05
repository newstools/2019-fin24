Eskom announced on Sunday morning that load shedding was not
expected for the day thanks to a drop in demand during the holiday period
and a return of some generating units to service. But as of Sunday morning, a massive 14,574MW remains missing from SA’s
electricity system due to unplanned breakdowns at power stations. Any unplanned outages
above 9,500 MW mean that system is severely constrained and that load shedding
may be on the cards. Eskom said the system remains vulnerable and unpredictable, and the load shedding remains a possibility. It will continue to
use emergency power generation if necessary. This involves using open
cycle gas turbines and pumped-storage hydroelectric plants. These are very
expensive ways of generating power, particularly the gas turbines, which
require large quantities of diesel. They can only be used for short
periods before diesel and water reserves start running out. South Africa has been hit by severe load shedding in February, October and December this year. After the economy shrank in the third quarter, economists fear that the load shedding in the fourth quarter could land SA in a recession.

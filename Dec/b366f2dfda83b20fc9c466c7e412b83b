There is no loadshedding expected on Sunday, according to Eskom. It said in a statement that this is as a result of a drop in demand during the holiday period and a return of some generating units to service.Eskom will continue to use emergency reserves to supplement capacity if necessary over this period. It, however, reminds customers that as the system continues to be vulnerable and unpredictable, the possibility of loadshedding remains. Breakdowns (UCLF) were at 12 956MW as at 06:30 Sunday morning. Eskom's technical teams will continue to work over the holiday period to monitor the situation, carry out planned maintenance and to work at reducing unplanned breakdowns to below 9 500MW to enable us to minimise the possibility of loadshedding. * Compiled by Carin Smith

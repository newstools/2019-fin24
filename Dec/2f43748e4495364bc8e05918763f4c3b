After having opened and trading mostly firmer in the morning
session on Thursday, the local bourse relinquished most of its gains despite
eventually closing firmer on the day. Disappointing South African mining production data played a
factor in this retracement as mining production year-on-year for the month of October
contracted by 2.9%, worsening from a prior recording of -0.6%. Producer
inflation for the month of November also slowed according to data released by
Stats SA. PPI month-on-month was recorded of -0.3% which was better than the
forecast of 0.3% as well as the prior recording of 0.3%. PPI year-on-year was
recorded at 2.3% which was an improvement from the prior recording of 3%. The rand strengthened overnight against the greenback as it
closed below R14.70/$. The local unit was trading relatively flat in today’s
session before it was recorded trading 0.58% firmer at R14.58/$ at 17:00. On the international markets, the US Fed interest rate decision
on Wednesday did not result in significant volatility for stocks. On Thursday,
the ECB reiterated its commitment to continue bond purchases which saw the euro
nudge higher. However, stocks in that bloc were trading marginally softer on
the day. On the JSE, index heavyweight Naspers [JSE:NPN] led gains as
it advanced 1.22% to close at R2075.00, while Prosus [JSE:PRX] gained 1.18% to

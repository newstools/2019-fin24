Zimbabwe’s state-owned Zesa Holdings escalated power cuts to
as long as 24 hours after losing regional power imports, while local generation
capacity remains critically constrained. The power utility has a non-binding agreement to import as
much as 400 MW of power from South Africa’s Eskom, which has been unable to
meet local demand and has implemented rolling blackouts, now in their sixth
day. "Load-shedding is thus being implemented over and above
the advertised schedule," Zesa said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. The power utility said it will be advising customers of
progress on restoration of imports and improved local generation to minimise
the effects of load shedding. Zimbabwe has been experiencing daily outages of as much as
18 hours daily owing to a drought that has slashed its hydropower supply. The
situation is exacerbated by frequent breakdowns at its main thermal power
station, Hwange.

The JSE advanced to close firmer on
Wednesday after a lukewarm start to the session. The local bourse seemed to shrug off the
worse than expected South African GDP data which was released on Tuesday as it
soldiered higher with other global markets. World indices rose on the back of
speculation that the USA and China will reach a trade deal following reports
over the past couple of sessions to the contrary. This trend of the markets
reacting to trade headlines seems likely to persist well into the new year as
both parties try to come to an agreement. There was further disappointment in terms
of local economic data as the Standard Bank PMI reading for November fell to
48.6 from a prior recording of 49.4, which was also worse than the forecasted
49.1. The rand took direction from a weakening US dollar which saw it advance
to a session high of R14.53 before it was recorded trading 0.32% firmer at
R14.58/$ at 17.00 CAT. On the local market, Quilter [JSE:QLT]
closed amongst the dayâ€™s biggest gainers as it advanced 4.93% to close at
R28.50, while Old Mutual [JSE:OMU] gained 2.11% to close at R18.38. Food
producer, Rhodes Food Group [JSE:RFG] surged 4.69% to close at R16.98, while
Zeder Investments [JSE:ZED] climbed 3.84% to close at R4.87. Index heavyweight,
Naspers [JSE:NPN] added 2.18% to close at R2065.00, while diversified mining
giant Anglo American PLC [JSE:AGL] rose 1.61% to close at R389.66. Other

gained 3.46% to close at R131.79, Sasol [JSE:SOL] which gained 2.94% to close
at R263.99, and Bid Corporation [JSE:BID] which closed at R332.14 after gaining
1.81%. Accelerate Property Fund [JSE:APF]
plummeted 18.24% to close at R1.39 following the release of weaker half-year
interim results. Cement maker, PPC Ltd [JSE:PPC] lost 3.99% as it close at

American Platinum [JSE:AMS] which closed at R1285.00 after losing 1.09%. The JSE All-Share index eventually closed
0.82% firmer while the JSE Top-40 index gained 1.06%. All the major indices
advanced on the day with the Financials index taking the bulk of the gains as
it rose 1.16%. The Industrials and Resources indices gained 0.9% and 0.75%
respectively. At 17.00 CAT, Gold was 0.12% softer at
$1475.45/Oz, Platinum had shed 0.55% to trade at $904.95/Oz, and Palladium was
up 0.43% to trade at $1864.00/Oz. Brent crude was bolstered by the positive
news on the trade war which saw the rise on the day before it was recorded
trading 3.5% firmer at $62.95/barrel just after the JSE close.

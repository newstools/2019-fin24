Eskom says it is not expecting to have to implement load shedding on Tuesday. The likelihood of power cuts for the remainder of the week is low. But cuts could be implemented at short notice with the power system still "vulnerable", it said.Â  The power utility said it may have to continue using emergency resources during the week "if necessary". "Our technical teams will continue to work over the holiday period to monitor the situation and to work at reducing unplanned breakdowns to below 9 500MW to enable us to minimise the risk of load shedding," said Eskom on Tuesday.   This comes after the power utility did not implement rotational power cuts over the long weekend after pressure on the national grid dipped. The president addressed the media last week Wednesday after cutting short an official visit to Egypt, saying Eskom had to be more "proactive" and "agile". He said at the time that, from Tuesday 17 December to January 15, 2020, Eskom management gave him the assurance that the utility "should not be in a position to have any form of load shedding". Ramaphosa added that he had instructed all managers that leave until January is cancelled.

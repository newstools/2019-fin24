Eskom says that it does not expect to institute load shedding on New Year's Eve or on New Year's Day. The power utility on Tuesday, in a power status update, said a drop in electricity demand, as well as the expected return of some generating units to service will help hold off power cuts over the next two days. Eskom says it will continue to rely on "emergency reserves" to supplement capacity if necessary. The power utility added that the system "continues to be vulnerable and unpredictable" and that the possibility of load shedding remains. "Our technical teams will continue to work over the holiday period to monitor the situation, to carry out planned maintenance and to work at reducing unplanned breakdowns to below 9 500MW to enable us to minimise the possibility of load shedding," the statement read.

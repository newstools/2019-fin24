After implementing stage 6 load shedding for the first time on Monday, Eskom says it will continue with stage 4 load shedding on Tuesday until 11pm. Stage 4 allows for up to 4 000MW to be cut from the national grid. Eskom has warned that cuts are likely to continue for the rest of the week as it battles severe capacity constraints caused by unplanned outages and flooding. On Monday it announced that heavy rains and floods at three power stations caused its already-reduced generation capacity to plunge further. The power utility's acting CEO and interim executive chairperson Jabu Mabuza said on Monday evening that a key reason for the implementation of stage 6 load shedding was the failure of a power supply line feeding electricity to incline conveyors feeding coal to silos at Medupi power station On Tuesday morning, in a power update, Eskom said that "while progress has been made with coal handling at Medupi Power Station, breakdowns are at 15 200MW as at 05:43 [on Tuesday]". 15 200MW amounts to more than a third of the power utility's nominal total generating capacity. "The incessant rains continue to impact coal handling and operations at our power stations," said Eskom.   President Cyril Ramaphosa, in a statement on Monday, said that public anger over the 'devastating' power cuts was understandable, while Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan apologised on eNCA.

The JSE finally matched trends with global
markets on Friday as it closed firmer following a robust session. The local bourse has lagged global
sentiment over the past two sessions primarily due to weak local data. On the
global markets, the USA released its non-farm payrolls data which showed that
the US economy added 266 000 jobs in the month of November, which was better
than the forecasted 181 000 jobs. US unemployment rate also slowed to 3.5% from
a prior recording of 3.6% which sent the US dollar and the US equity futures
higher. The rand held steady against the greenback
as it was range bound between R14.61/$ and R14.67/$. The rand was trading 0.02%
weaker at R14.64/$ at 17.00 CAT. Accelerate Property Fund [JSE:APF] rocketed

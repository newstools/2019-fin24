After having been suspended for almost nine months, SA Tourism (SAT) CEO Sisa Ntshona was found not guilty on Friday of charges brought against him. This was after an internal disciplinary hearing was held with an independent presiding officer. Fin24 reported in April this year that Ntshona was suspended by the SAT board. The board said it was investigating allegations received against Ntshona via its anonymous tip-offs reporting mechanism. It did not elaborate on what the allegations were, and neither did Ntshona. According to the board, it placed Ntshona on precautionary suspension in order to conduct a free and fair investigation. "This would allow the CEO to focus on responding to the allegations as well as guarantee the integrity and transparency of the process to be followed," the board said in a statement at the time, adding that investigations would be conducted in the "best interest of all parties". When told of his suspension, Ntshona was surprised, he told Fin24 at the time. He was also puzzled by how long it took the board to finally inform him what the reasons for his suspension were. His suspension came just few weeks ahead of World Travel Market Africa in Cape Town and Africa's Tourism Indaba in Durban - a very inopportune time, in his view. There are no indications yet of the next steps to be taken. * SA Tourism has indicated that it will issue a statement in this regard in due course. This article will be updated then.

Eskom says it does not expect to have to institute rotational power cuts on Christmas day. It also does not plan cut power on the Day of Goodwill (26 December). The power utility, in a status update on Tuesday evening, said no load shedding was envisioned due to a decrease in electricity consumption over the holiday period and the return of some generating units to service. "We however remind customers that, as the system continues to be vulnerable and unpredictable, the possibility of load shedding remains."   The utility says it will continue to use emergency power resources toÂ supplement capacity if necessary.

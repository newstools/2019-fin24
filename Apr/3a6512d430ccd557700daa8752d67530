Glencore said it’s under investigation by the US Commodity
Futures Trading Commission for possible corrupt practices, the latest legal
headache for the world’s biggest commodity trader. The probe comes after the London-listed company was
subpoenaed last year by the US Justice department for documents relating to its
dealings in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela since 2007. Glencore said Thursday that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) had notified it of investigations into whether the company and its
subsidiaries "may have violated certain provisions of the Commodity
Exchange Act and/or CFTC Regulations through corrupt practices in connection
with commodities." The company said it believes the CFTC’s investigations
"have a similar scope in terms of subject matter" to the justice
department probe, which became public last July. The commodity trading industry is facing a multitude of
bribery and corruption investigations in jurisdictions ranging from Brazil to
the US, drawing comparisons with the early 1980s when Glencore’s founder Marc
Rich was prosecuted for tax evasion. The director of enforcement at the CFTC said last month in a
speech that the agency was investigating overseas fraud and manipulation under
the Commodities Exchange Act. "Companies and individuals engaging in foreign corrupt
practices should recognise that this sort of misconduct might constitute fraud,
manipulation, false reporting, or a number of other types of violations under
the CEA, and thus be subject to enforcement actions brought by the CFTC,"
James McDonald said in New Orleans. Glencore’s shares have declined about 8%  since the justice department started is
investigation last year, even as most miners gained. Investor sentiment is still
negative regarding Glencore, analysts at Jefferies LLC noted last week.

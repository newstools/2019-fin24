The Department of Energy announced a petrol price increase of 54 cents a litre for 93 and 95 unleaded for the month of May on Sunday. Diesel has a one cent per
litre increase, while illuminating
paraffin sees a three cents per litre increase. In a statement the Department of Energy said the
international factors amounted to about 54.00c/l on petrol and 1.00c/l on
diesel and 3.00 cents per litre. "The
settling of contagion risks from emerging marketsÂ  provided a foundation
for the rand's strengthening trend. This decreased the contribution on the Basic Fuel Price of petrol,
diesel and illuminating paraffin by about 13.00c/l," the statement said.

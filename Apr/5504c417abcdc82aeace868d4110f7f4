A Chilean car shipping company has been referred to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution for collusive tendering, price fixing and market division, the Competition Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. Compania Sud Americana De Vapores SA (CSAV) is alleged to have breached the Competition Act relating to tenders issued by Ford Motor Company, the Commission said. CSAV is accused of colluding with Mitsui OSK Lines Limited (MOL) in the shipment of Ford vehicles from South Africa to Europe and the Mediterranean, including North Africa. According to the statement, in 2015, CSAV paid a R8.8m penalty following a consent agreement with the Commission relating to a similar tender issued by General Motors. However, CSAV has denied involvement in the Ford tender. To date, four companies have paid over R310m in administrative penalties in the matter, the Commission said. "Between 2015 and 2018, NYK, WWL and Eukor Car Carriers admitted collusion and settled with the Commission," the statement read. In 2017, the Commission referred Hoegh Autoliners Holdings AS to the Tribunal for prosecution on seven charges of cartel conduct on similar shipping tenders issued by several motor manufacturers. MOL was granted leniency for its involvement in the cartel conduct in exchange for information and full cooperation in the matter.

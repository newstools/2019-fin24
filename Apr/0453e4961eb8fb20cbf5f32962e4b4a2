A power outage at Cape Town International Airport on Wednesday evening was affecting the airport's operations, a spokesperson from the airport confirmed. The power outage, which started approximately at 17:50, was caused when the Eskom power feed to the airport was interrupted, Deidre Davids, senior manager of corporate affairs, told Fin24. Davids did not give detailed information on the impact of the outage, but said that "various systems" were affected. "It has affected various systems and will impact airport operations," she said. By approximately 18:30, power was restored. Davids said certain systems needed to be rebooted and were expected to "start coming on stream". Flights were landing and departing, she said. Passengers were requested to stay in touch with their airlines for up to date flight information, Davids added. The airport has apologised for any inconvenience caused. An Eskom spokesperson declined to comment at the time of publication.

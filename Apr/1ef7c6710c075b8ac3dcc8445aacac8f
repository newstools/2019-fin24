A giant 1 758-carat diamond, the second-biggest ever
discovered, has been found in Botswana. But unlike its rivals, it won’t fetch a
record-breaking price. Lucara Diamond Corporation said it unearthed the stone –
roughly the size of a tennis ball – at its Karowe project in Botswana, a mine
renowned for its huge gems including the previous holder of the No. 2 position. Still, the company said the diamond is a near gem of
variable quality, meaning it won’t yield incredibly valuable polished diamonds
on par with earlier finds. Lucara’s Karowe mine is becoming famous for giant stones. In
2015, Lucara found the 1 109-carat Lesedi La Rona, which at the time was the
second-largest ever and eventually sold for $53m (about R760m). The mine has also yielded a 813-carat stone that fetched a
record $63m (about R900m). Those two gems were both much more valuable Type-IIa stones. Still, the latest find shows that Karowe’s plant can process
and detect huge gems without breaking them, a consistent headache when trying
to separate brittle stones from hundreds of tons of waste rock. "Karowe has now produced two diamonds greater than 1 000
carats in just four years, affirming the coarse nature of the resource and the
likelihood of recovering additional, large, high quality diamonds in the future,"
Eira Thomas, Lucara’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. Lucara, based in Vancouver, Canada, rose as much as 12%, the
most in a year. The biggest diamond ever discovered is the 3 106-carat
Cullinan, found near Pretoria in South Africa in 1905. It was cut into several polished gems, the two largest of
which – the Great Star of Africa and the Lesser Star of Africa – are set in the
Crown Jewels of Britain.

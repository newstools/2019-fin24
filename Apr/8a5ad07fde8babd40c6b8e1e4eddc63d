Slack Technologies submitted its plans to US regulators to go public through an unusual direct listing. The workplace-messaging company’s 
filing on Friday confirms its plans to avoid a traditional public offering 
and instead list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange 
under the symbol SK. The direct listing will allow the San Francisco-based company’s 
investors to sell their shares without their holdings being diluted by 
Slack issuing new stock or waiting for a lock-up period to expire.

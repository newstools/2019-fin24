Tokyo shares gave up early gains to end flat on Tuesday as investors locked in profits following two days of gains. The Nikkei 225 index inched down 3.72 points, to 21 505.31 while the broader Topix index lost 0.25% to 1 611.69. The market started on a high note following a strong lead from Wall Street as dealers cheered positive US and Chinese manufacturing data, while they were also buoyed by optimism over trade talks between the world's top two economies. "But investors cashed in on the recent gains" in late trading, which pushed key indexes into negative territory, Daiwa Securities chief technical analyst Eiji Kinouchi told AFP.

The JSE closed weaker on Thursday as
markets paused while awaiting fresh clues from the ongoing trade talks between
China and the USA. There was disappointment in Europe
following the release of German Factory Orders data which contracted by 4.2%,
which missed the widely forecasted growth of 0.3%. This further highlights the
prudence of the ECB’s decision to continue with its liquidity stimulus program
after it warned of slowing growth in its previous policy meeting. Trading in
Asia and Europe was mixed but, in the US, the major indices managed to open
firmer following gains led by a Boeing and Caterpillar. The US Non-Farm
Payrolls numbers slated for release on Friday could provide markets with a
potential catalyst for significant volatility. The rand held steady in today’s session as
it traded mostly flat. This was also supported by the lukewarm US dollar which
was range bound within a narrow trading range. The rand briefly weakened to a
session low of R14.22/$ before it was recorded trading 0.26% firmer at R14.11/$
at 17.00 CAT. Nampak [JSE:NPK] came under significant
pressure as it closed at R10.28 after dropping 8.3%. Retailers also traded
mostly lower on the day. Truworths [JSE:TRU] fell 1.9% to R70.78, Shoprite
[JSE:SHP] closed 2.7% weaker at R157.20, and Mr Price [JSE:MRP] lost 1.93% to

Properties [JSE:ITU] lost 1.88% to close at R19.36. A volatile trading session
ensued for Kumba Iron Ore [JSE:KIO] which eventually closed 1.65% weaker at R441.00,
South32 [JSE:S32] closed 1.59% lower at R38.38. MTN Group [JSE:MTN] managed to close amongst
the day’s biggest gainers after it advanced 2.92% to close at R92.37. Aspen
Pharmacare [JSE:APN] was still buoyant on the back of the recent positive news
concerning the approval of the sale of its milk-formula business. The stock
managed to add another 2.48% as it closed at R100.36. Multichoice [JSE:MCG]
gained 2.84% as it closed at R123.60, while Telkom [JSE:TKG] closed 1.24%

closed 0.37% weaker, while the broader JSE All-Share index lost 0.39%. All the
major indices retreated in today’s session. The Resources index was the biggest
loser as it dropped 1.37%, while the Financials and Industrials indices lost 0.14%
and 0.02% respectively. At 17.00 CAT, Gold was 0.19% weaker at $1287.46/Oz,

firmer at $69.32/barrel just after the JSE close.

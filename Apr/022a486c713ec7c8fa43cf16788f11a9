Johannesburg - Top officials, politicians and businessmen of the ANC are facing tax claims of more than R250m on income earned from Bosasa, the services company at the heart of a widespread corruption scandal, the Johannesburg Sunday Times reports. The South Africa Revenue Service (SARS) has concluded preliminary investigations that may lead to charges of under-declared income, overstated expenses and other misrepresentations against members of the ANC, Sunday Times said. Those on the SARS list, the newspaper reported, include: Angelo Agrizzi, Bosasa’s chief operating officer from 1999 to 2016, told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that’s probing corruption during Zuma’s rule that the company paid R300 000 a month to the former leader’s charitable foundation in return for protection from prosecution.

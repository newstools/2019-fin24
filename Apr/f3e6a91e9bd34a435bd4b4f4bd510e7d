The Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry in partnership with the Manchu group and MICT SETA recently launched a 3-month unemployed youth skills and enterprise development programme. The Durban Chamber will be project managing the programme which the Manchu Group will facilitate over the next three months. Sixty unemployed youth have been selected to participate in the programme restricted to the information and technology (IT) and agriculture sectors. The Durban Chamber first announced the enterprise development partnership in January 2019, calling for applicants under the age of 35, who are unemployed and have a business-related qualification. The response was massive and the Durban Chamber's Enterprise Development team then reviewed all the applications and short-listed sixty candidates. The Durban Chamber's chief operations officer Zee Zeka-Ngcamu said it was very important for young graduates to be equipped for the 4th Industrial Revolution. The programme comprises eight modules which are SETA accredited. Content focus is on project management and work readiness. The MICT SETA will be giving all candidates a stipend of R 2 850 monthly until the end of the three-month programme. Nasirah Govindsamy from MICT SETA said internships, work-integrated-learning bursaries and skills programmes were learning interventions run by SETA’s to develop skills in our country's workforce. The Durban Chamber's strategic purpose is to help create a conducive economic and business environment to facilitate and promote economic growth in the region in partnership with key stakeholders. The Durban Chamber's Enterprise Development unit aims to support small, medium and micro enterprises in the Durban area. The unit focuses on providing business information, business skills development and networking platforms to Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise Businesses (SMMEs).

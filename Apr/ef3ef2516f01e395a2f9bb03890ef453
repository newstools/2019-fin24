The South African Broadcasting Corporation has terminated the employment contract of Chief Operations Officer Chris Maroleng, according to a statement issued by the public broadcaster on Tuesday afternoon. In a brief statement, the SABC said: "The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) Board met on Tuesday, 23 April 2019. "After due consideration of the findings and recommendations of a disciplinary process, the Board resolved to terminate the contract of employment of its Chief Operations Officer, Mr. Chris Maroleni, with immediate effect." Fin24 understands that the former COO's surname is Maroleni, but he is commonly known as Chris Maroleng. Earlier in April Maroleng was found guilty onÂ three charges, which included gross negligence, following a disciplinary inquiry that was initiated late in 2018. This is one of the first major actions taken by the newly appointed board. President Cyril Ramaphosa had approved the appointment of eight new board members in April, following a process in Parliament.

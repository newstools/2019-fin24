The JSE closed weaker on Wednesday mainly on the back of
losses recorded across the industrials and financials indices. The rand weakened further in today’s session as it fell to a
session low of R14.42/$. This resulted in weakness being recorded for most of
the financials on the JSE. Resources also came under pressure after JP Morgan cut its
outlook for mining giant Anglo American to neutral. This was further compounded
by a statement from Goldman Sachs stating that it sees scope for
underperformance in the mining sector. The US dollar remained buoyant throughout today’s session as
it peaked at 97.84 index points on the US dollar index. Subsequently the rand
was trading 1.1% weaker at R14.40/$ at 17:00. RDI REIT [JSE:RPL] led the losses on the JSE as it fell 13.79%
to close at R25.00. Health sector stocks also came under pressure on the day
which saw Life Healthcare [JSE:LHC] drop 6.27% to close at R26.00, while
Ascendis Health [JSE:ASC] lost 5.68% to close at R4.15. Telecoms providers Vodacom [JSE:VOD] and MTN Group [JSE:MTN]
weakened after one South African regulator ruled that the two company’s are
overcharging customers for data. Vodacom eventually closed 4.29% weaker at R115.86,
while MTN Group lost 2.4% to close at R102.25. Anglo American [JSE:AGL] led losses amongst the miners as it
fell 2.94% to end the day at R387.95. The contagion spread to other miners such
as Glencore [JSE:GLN] which lost 2.46% to close at R60.75, as well as South32
[JSE:S32] which weakened to R34.43 after shedding 1.35%. Gains were relatively modest on the day particularly for
blue-chip stocks. Richemont [JSE:CFR] eked out gains of 0.74% to end the day at
R107.58, while Zeder Investments [JSE:ZED] added 0.93% to close at R4.34. Steinhoff International [JSE:SNH] managed to close as one of
the day’s biggest gainers after it advanced 6.21% to close at R1.88. Listed property stocks were also buoyant on the day with
gains being recorded for Capital & Counties [JSE:CCO] which gained 1.87% to
close at R45.22, Investec Property Fund [JSE:IPF] which added 1.39% to close at
R16.00, and Hammerson PLC [JSE:HMN] which closed at R61.56 after gaining 1.67%. The JSE All-Share index eventually closed 0.74% lower while
the blue-chip JSE Top-40 index lost 0.75%. All the major indices closed lower on the day. Industrials
lost 0.2%, resources fell 1.16% and financials dropped 1.67%. Brent crude retreated marginally from its overnight highs to

No tax, more wealth According to the report, the high average wealth of people living in Monaco reflects the country's good tax structure - people living in Monaco pay no income tax. This attracts wealthy people to move there and also promotes business formation in the country. Furthermore, Monaco operates as an offshore centre for the European wealth sector, which brings a large number of wealthy financiers to the country. It is located on a prime part of the French Riviera and about 2 700 of Monaco's 40 000 residents are worth over $10m (about R143.4m). Monaco is also seen as a hot spot for super-yacht owners and one of the most popular yacht docking spots in the Mediterranean. Apartments in Monaco are the most expensive in the world per square meter. "Monaco has snob appeal. It is synonymous with wealth, luxury and fame," states the report.

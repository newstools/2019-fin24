The CEO of South African Tourism, Sisa Ntshona, has been suspended, the board said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon. The board is investigating allegations received against Ntshona via its anonymous tip-offs reporting mechanism, the statement said. It did not elaborate on what the allegations were. It said the investigations would be conducted in the "best interest of all parties". "The Board is obligated to thoroughly investigate these allegations, in the best interest of all parties concerned. "In order to conduct a free and fair investigation the Board has decided to place the CEO on precautionary suspension," the statement said. "This would allow the CEO to focus on responding to the allegations as well as guarantee the integrity and transparency of the process to be followed." Sthembiso Dlamini has been appointed as the acting CEO so that the work of the organisation continues smoothly, the statement added. This would guarantee the urgent filling of the vacant senior executive post and ensure that an "exceptional" Africaâ€™s Travel Indaba, scheduled for the beginning of May 2019, is delivered, the board said. No further comment will be made until the matter is finalised, the board added.

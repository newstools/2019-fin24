The local bourse traded mostly flat on Tuesday as global markets digested weaker than expected Chinese economic data. Global markets fretted after China released manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI data which came in worse than widely forecasted. This was also aided by disappointing results for Alphabet in the US on Monday which dampened investor optimism over the current earnings reporting season on Wall Street. The resumption of trade talks between the US and China also brought another dynamic into play as reports surfaced that the US is looking to leave some punitive tariffs in place as a means to enforce a deal. On the JSE, Coronation Fund Managers [JSE:CML] came under significant pressure following the release of a weaker trading statement, as well as its assets under management.

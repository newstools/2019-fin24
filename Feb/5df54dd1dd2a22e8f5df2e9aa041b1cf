Eskom announced through a statement on Sunday that it would be implementing load shedding that afternoon for the first time since early December. The statement said this was as a result of a shortage of capacity and a need to replenish and preserve emergency water and diesel resources. “Stage 2 calls for 2000MW to be rotationally load shed nationally at a given period. Load shedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout,” the statement said. The statement said load shedding period would run from 13:00 to 22:00. The municipal load shedding schedule can be found here.

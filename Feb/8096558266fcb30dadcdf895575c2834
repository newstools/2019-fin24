The South African Broadcasting Corporation is reviewing
the contracts of freelance on-air talent whose contracts are expiring in the
next month, it said in a statement on Thursday. It is doing this in line with industry best
practices, it added. The public service broadcaster is in dire straits
financially and has already asked government for a bailout. It previously proposed retrenchments, saying it
intended to retrench 981 permanent employees and 1 200 freelancers in a bid to
save around R440m per annum. It faced pressure not to proceed with the
retrenchments, however, including from Communications Minister Stella
Ndabeni-Abrahams. According to the statement, the current review is
an annual process informed by revenue, audience performance of programmes or
shows, return on investment and the overall strategic direction of SABC
platforms. "Management is currently engaging with Radio
and Sports freelance on-air talent about their respective contracts that are
expiring on March 31, 2019," the statement said. When he tabled his first budget last week in
Parliament, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni was frank regarding the financial
state of the SABC, saying if the broadcaster wanted a bailout, the same chief
re-organisation officer tasked with helping break Eskom into three companies
would be paying Auckland Park a visit. On Thursday morning Parliament’s portfolio
committee on communications drafted a shortlist of 24 candidates to interview in
order to fill eight vacancies on the SABC board. The interviews will begin on
Tuesday.

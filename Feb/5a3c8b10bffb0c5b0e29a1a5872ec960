Denel is attending a major global defence exhibition in Abu Dhabi this week to explore new growth opportunities for business in the Middle East and North African countries. Denel's innovative products and systems will form the centrepiece of the South African pavilion at the International Defence Exhibition – IDEX 2019 – hosted in the United Arab Emirates. "Our intention is to showcase the quality and the versatility of Denel's products, especially in the fields of turret systems for combat vehicles, integrated weapon stations and missile technology," says Danie du Toit the Group CEO of Denel. "This is an opportunity to reposition Denel as an innovative defence and technology company and a trusted partner of clients who want to acquire our proven products. The region is familiar with Denel's range of products and we want to build on this reputation by highlighting our capabilities." IDEX 2019 is the largest defence and technology exhibition in the Middle East and North Africa and is expected to attract more than 1 200 exhibitors and some 110 000 visitors. Du Toit says IDEX 2019 is an important opportunity to meet with defence decision-makers, industry leaders and analysts and to raise awareness about the range of Denel's products and capabilities. Countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Qatar are considering major defence acquisitions in the near future.

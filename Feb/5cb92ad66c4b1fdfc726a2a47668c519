After Twentieth Century Fox’s Bohemian Rhapsody became the highest-grossing musical biopic of all
time, Viacom’s Paramount Pictures is looking to find success with another
legendary artist: Elton John. The studio released a trailer on Thursday for Rocketman, which depicts the British
rocker’s rise during the 1960s and ’70s. Taron Egerton, known for the Kingsman
films, stars as John. The movie, scheduled for May 31, seems well timed. Last
year’s Bohemian Rhapsody, which chronicled
the career of Freddie Mercury and Queen, racked up $212.3m at the domestic box
office and $854.6m globally, according to Box Office Mojo. The performance
vaulted it past Straight Outta Compton and
Walk the Line to become the No. 1
music-themed biopic. Bohemian Rhapsody also
is nominated for five Oscars at this weekend’s Academy Awards, including best
actor (for star Rami Malek) and best picture. With Rocketman,
Paramount may be covering some similar themes. Like Mercury, John is a gay man
and was heavily involved in the fight against AIDS in the 1980s. But the
trailer doesn’t emphasise his sexuality. One criticism of Bohemian
Rhapsody was how the film handled the star’s relationships with men and his
AIDS-related death. Critics will likely be watching closely how Rocketman depicts those themes. Unlike many biopics, Rocketman
portrays an artist who is still alive and performing. The 71-year-old John is
currently on a 300-plus-show tour called "Farewell Yellow Brick Road."
He’s also an executive producer on the film.

Europe's stock markets slid in opening deals on Friday, hit by doubts over US-China trade talks and the global economic outlook, dealers said. London's benchmark FTSE 100 index of major blue-chip firms dipped 0.1% to 7 086.63 points compared with Thursday's closing level. In the eurozone, the Paris CAC 40 index also shed 0.1% to 4 980.81 points, and Frankfurt's DAX 30 sank 0.3% to 10 991.79.

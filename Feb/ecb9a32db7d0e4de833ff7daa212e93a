Elon Musk’s
run-in with regulators and executive exits have made it all but certain that
his electric-car company will have to pay $920m to bondholders on Friday after
Tesla’s stock failed to rise above a critical price level. Tesla is on
the hook to settle the March 1 convertible bond maturity in cash, the largest
debt payment to date in its almost 16-year history. To make some of the payout
using stock, the shares would have had to reach a volume-weighted average price
of $359.87 for the 20-day trading period that began January 29. The figure was
about $306.91 as of Tuesday, the final day of that span. Cash or stock – but cash likely Holders
must decide on Wednesday if they would rather convert to equity or receive
cash, and it’s unlikely they’ll opt for stock. Based on
the trading of Tesla’s shares in the last 20 days, if a holder decided to
convert their investment to stock, they’d receive a conversion value of $850
between cash and shares, instead of the $1 000 par value at maturity that Tesla
would pay out fully in cash. Tesla had
about $3.7bn of cash and equivalents as of December 31, more than enough to
make the principal payment plus another $1.15m in interest. A representative
for Tesla referred to comments in the company’s fourth-quarter shareholder
letter, which said it had "sufficient cash on hand to comfortably settle
in cash our convertible bond that will mature in March 2019." Tesla’s
shares haven’t closed above $359.87 since December 14. When reporting
fourth-quarter earnings on January 30, the company missed analysts’ estimates
and said its longtime chief financial officer was resigning. More recently,
Tesla’s critical Model 3 sedan lost a coveted recommendation from Consumer
Reports, and Musk is running into regulatory trouble again because of his
tweeting. The stock is down more than 10% this year. Should
bondholders want to convert, Tesla said it would settle the conversion with a
50/50 split of cash and stock, Bloomberg reported in December.

As the deadline of early March approaches for the National Energy Regulator of South Africa to announce whether Eskom will be granted the 15% tariff hike it has asked for, the South African National Civic Organisation has called for "civic activism" to stop the hike. The civic organisation released a statement on Monday in which it rejected Eskom’s request for a 15% tariff hike. The energy regulator held public hearings about the tariff hike between January and February in various provinces around the country. "Sanco is extremely concerned about the 15% electricity hike which Eskom wishes to bill on consumers. This electricity hike will have a devastating effect on the consumers who are already constrained by the state of our economy," the statement said. The statement said while Sanco understood the challenges at Eskom, the organisation did not agree with the 15% increase, saying it would further impoverish already pressurised consumers. "The 15% electricity hike is rejected and citizens are at this stage called upon to exercise civic activism to stop this unreasonable hike which will leave the poor even poorer," the statement said. Spokesperson for Sanco’s interim national leadership Packet Seaketso could not be reached by Fin24 to explain what the statement meant by "civic activism". Approached for comment, Nersa spokesperson Charles Hlebela said: "[A] decision will be made first week of March; [the] exact date will be communicated in due course".

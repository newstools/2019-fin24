The JSE Gold index has broken out of an almost two-year sideways range and has a significantly higher target in place now. This makes gold stocks a very attractive buy on short-term weakness. Recommendation: Buy gold stocks on a pullbackÂ Current trend: Short and medium-term up. Long-term turning up. Chart setup: The JSE Gold Index has broken out above line 2, which is a resistance zone going back to May 2017. This is a very significant development. Strategy details: Large-cap gold stocks are to be bought for the med-term (that is months). Look to buy on some weakness though. Target: Its main upside target is 2430, based on its large rounding bottom pattern. (In the immediate short-term, it has reached an initial target zone at 1720-1790, so it's likely to take a temporary breather soon, to allow for new buying). Stop-loss: A weekly (that is Friday) closing price below 1440. (At the time of writing it was trading at 1695).  * Colin Abrams is an independent technical analyst.

The JSE closed softer on Thursday on the back of weakness in financials and retailers after the rand fell against the greenback. The rand weakened considerably against the US dollar overnight as it breached the R14/$ level. In today’s session it fell to a session low of R14.20/$ as the US dollar extended its gains earlier. The US dollar did retreat after the release of US retail sales data which came in worse than anticipated, but this did not result in significant strengthening for the rand and other emerging market currencies. The rand was trading 0.84% weaker at R14.18/$ at 17:00. There was more disappointment locally as Statistics SA released South Africa’s Mining Production numbers for the month of December.

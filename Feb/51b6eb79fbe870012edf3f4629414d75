The JSE traded mostly flat on Thursday as
gains recorded on the financials were offset by losses recorded on the
resources index. The ongoing trade talks between the USA and
China continue to dominate global market sentiment, and this was more evident
today with the release of Manufacturing PMI data from key markets such as
Germany, the Eurozone and the USA which came in worse than anticipated. This
further highlights the importance of these talks to global trade and ultimately
global growth.  The US dollar weakened against a basket of
major currencies as indicated by the US dollar index in earlier trade. This was
due to the sentiment surrounding the USA’s ISM Manufacturing data release. As a
result, the rand rallied to a session high of R13.87/$ along with other
emerging market currencies. However, the gains were short-lived because the US
dollar recouped all its losses to trade firmer on the day. At 17:00, the
rand was trading 0.01% weaker at R14.01/$. On the JSE, financials were lifted when the
rand firmed which saw stocks such as ABSA Group gain 3.65% to close
at R177.03, Nedbank [JSE:NED] added 1.49% to end the day R289.00, and Standard
Bank [JSE:SBK] closed 1.81% firmer at R194.00. African Rainbow Minerals
[JSE:ARM] was one of the day’s biggest gainers after the stock recorded gains
of 6.19% to close at R4.29. Listed property stock, SA Corporate Real Estate
[JSE:SAC] added 4.25% close at R3.68, while Intu Properties [JSE:ITU] recouped
some of the previous session’s losses to end the day up 4.51% at R20.40. Anglo
American PLC [JSE:AGL] released a decent set of full-year results which
indicated moderate increases in revenue and reduction in net debt. The stock
closed 0.53% firmer at R366.96. Sibanye Stillwater [JSE:SGL] retreated on
the back of the release of its half year financial results which highlighted a
decrease in basic earnings. The stock lost 3.96% to close at R15.05. Lonmin
[JSE:LON] also struggled as it fell 6.22% to close at R12.67, while Gold Fields
[JSE:GFI] lost 3.67% to close at R57.80. Most of the miners traded weaker on
the day which saw BHP Group [JSE:BHP] lose 1.57% to close at R326.41, while
Glencore [JSE:GLN] closed at R55.06 after dropping 2.03%. Rand hedge, British
American Tobacco [JSE:BTI] weakened by 1.31% to end the day at R514.70. Woolworths [JSE:WHL] was dragged by the weaker earnings recorded in its
half-year financial results which saw the stock close 2.91% lower at R43.05. The JSE All-Share index eventually closed 0.09%
weaker, while the JSE Top-40 index shed 0.1%. The Financials index stood out as
it gained 1.38% on the day, however the Resources and Industrials indices shed
0.98% and 0.43% respectively. At 17:00, Palladium was 0.73% weaker at
$1478.27/oz, Platinum was up 0.07% at $828.04/oz, and Gold had lost 0.56% to
trade at $1330.88/oz. Brent eased mildly following speculation of
higher US crude oil inventories recorded over the past week. The commodity was
trading 0.03% weaker at $67.06/barrel just after the JSE close after having
traded mostly weaker on the day.

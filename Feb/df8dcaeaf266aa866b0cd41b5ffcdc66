South Africa should not panic over misinformation regarding
Zambia's power utility and loans received from China, President of the
Economics Association of Zambia, Lubinda Haabazoka, has said. Speaking to Fin24 on the sidelines of the 2019 Investing in African
Mining Indaba at the Cape Town International Convention Centre, Haabazoka said
Zambia was borrowing from China "sustainably". Haabazoka's remarks come following speculation in 2018 that
Zambia would have to surrender its power utility, Zesco, to China over defaults
on debt. In SA, meanwhile, a loan the China Development Bank granted
Eskom during the BRICS summit in Johannesburg last year sparked similar controversy.
The terms of the loan are subject to confidentiality clauses, which drew calls
for the details to be made public. Haabazoka denied that Zambia would have to surrender Zesco
to China, calling such claims a symptom of a fresh "global trade war
between the east and the west". "The African continent, including Zambia, is being used
as a pawn in the global trade war we are seeing between the east and the west. "Zesco is an example of this. But the law of Zambia is
clear. Entities cannot be given as collateral if Zambia defaults on a
loan," said Haabazoka. Haabazoka said the loan, which Zesco took to finance a
hydro-power project, was not a bad decision, as the debt with Chinese investors
could be re-negotiated. Western creditors seldom offer this, he added. "We get funding from both the east and the west. The
conditions we expect from both are the same. Of course, China loans money at a
lower interest rate. But it is not true that the Chinese are taking Zambian
property. Zambia continues to borrow from China sustainably," Haabazoka
said. He said South Africa and its entities should feel free to
take advantage of financing opportunities from China, as long as such
opportunities are in the interests of South Africans.

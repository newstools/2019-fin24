The JSE All-share Index is testing a critical resistance zone right now. Will it give an important upside breakout, or will it fail from here? The breakout levels to monitor are shown on its chart below. Recommendation: Buy a breakout or off support. Current trend: Short- and medium-term sideways. Strategy: Buy a breakout above 55 000 (line/s 3), or a reversal up from the 53 200 level. Chart Setup: The JSE All-share Index has now reached a critical resistance zone at line/s 3 (54 740 to 55 000). The question is where it will break out from here, or not. Right now, it's formed a short-term broadening formation (blue lines) just below its critical resistance zone. This is potentially a build-up of energy for the important upside breakout. - Its short-term Stochastic is a relatively oversold zone, so there is potential for more rallying. Strategy Details: My feeling is the price will move sideways for a while. Nevertheless, a breakout and close above 55 100 (above line/s 3) will be a breakout buy signal for the JSE (my preference is to buy the first minor pullback thereafter). - Or, buy a pullback to short-term support at 53 200. Do whichever happens first. Target: Between the blue lines of its broadening formation, that is support at 53 200 and resistance (top line 3) at 54 960/55 000. A breakout of the resistance zone will target 56 200 initially (based on the broadening formation); but the main target will be 60 000 (based on the height of its sideways range since October projected up). Stop-loss: A close below 53 050 for buying off support, and below 54 500 for buying the upside breakout. * Colin Abrams is an independent technical analyst.

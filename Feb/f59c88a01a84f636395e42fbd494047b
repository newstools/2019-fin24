President Cyril Ramaphosa was right in his
assessment that the sun hasn't set on South Africa's mining industry, Aon's
global mining practice leader Paul Pryor has said. Speaking to Fin24 on the sidelines of the 2019
Investing in African Mining Indaba on Wednesday morning, Pryor mining companies
were "upbeat" about investing in SA, particularly in the areas of
exploration and expansion. "There is a lot of interest in mining here.
Gold might be in declining, since going deeper to explore gets more expensive,
but there is still a lot of platinum, vanadium, palladium and iron ore that
investors would be very interested in," said Pryor. The Mining Indaba is being held from 4-7 February
at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. Ramaphosa became the first
sitting South African president to formally address the event on Tuesday. Among concerns over dwindling resources, labour
unrest, commodity price exposure, sparse returns on investment in the short
term and climate change's impact on industry regulations, Ramaphosa took the
opportunity express his view that SA's mining industry was still thriving. Pryor also said battery metals were a compelling
proposition for miners. Pryor said the trend of stepping away from financing
and insuring coal projects only applied to thermal coal, which was used in
power stations and emitted more greenhouse gases. Metallurgical coal had significantly lower
emissions and, as such, may still enjoy a great deal of investment, finance and
insurance in the near future, he said.

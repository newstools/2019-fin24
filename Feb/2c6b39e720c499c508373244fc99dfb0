Private Property South Africa has acquired the Property Buyer Show from media company Spintelligent. The transaction is part of a new strategy initiated by Private Property's recently appointed CEO Amasi Mwela to expand and enhance the service it offers its customers.Â "The Property Buyer Show will allow us to improve the range of services we offer to our customers by creating a rounded offering that covers the whole property life cycle. It will also position us favourably for what we believe to be the next great opportunity in real estate: the growing numbers of South Africans who are entering the middle class and looking to begin building wealth through property," says Mwela. "This growing number of first-time property buyers have a clear understanding of what property can do for them, and we aim to be the partner they choose to realise their goals in an increasingly difficult economic climate. The Property Buyer Show gives us a solid platform on which to establish ourselves within this expanding segment." The show began in 2017 and its five events have attracted over 15 000 visitors. The 6th Property Buyer Show will be held in Cape Town in April 2019.

Tokyo shares closed lower on Friday, following a global market slide stemming from the lowered European economic outlook as well as receding hopes for smooth progress in US-China trade talks. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index dropped 2.01% or 418.11 points to end at 20 333.17. Over the week, it was down 2.19%. The broader Topix index lost 1.89% to 1 539.40. Over the week, it was down 1.61%. "Overall Tokyo shares were down due to concerns on the US-China trade dispute," Yoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at Okasan Online Securities, said in a commentary. Ito added that investors were cautious because of overnight falls of US and European shares. Investors also grew wary after the EU Commission said it expected growth of 1.3% in the eurozone this year, a significant cut from the 1.9% it predicted in November, citing risks including Brexit fears, Italian economic woes and the global trade war. In Japan, players adjusted their positions and locked in profits ahead of a three-day weekend, Okasan added. The Tokyo market will close Monday for a national holiday. Normal trading will resume on Tuesday. In the forex market, the dollar stood at ¥109.68, slightly lower than the ¥109.83 seen in New York on Thursday.

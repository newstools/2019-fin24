The lack of progress with the US-China trade talks further
heightened investors’ concerns on Friday which led to most global stock indices
trading weaker. Adding to the economic growth concerns flagged by the
European Union on Thursday, skepticism spread as US President Donald Trump said
that he did not plan to meet his Chinese counterpart before the March 1st
deadline set for a trade resolution. This new development lengthens the period
of uncertainty before concrete
resolution is reached. The JSE was not spared from the losses as most of the
bourse’s heavyweights traded under pressure. Sasol [JSE:SOL] had the biggest loss amongst the blue chips

Wall Street stocks dipped on Wednesday following a batch of mixed earnings results and ahead of key congressional testimony on trade and monetary policy. About 20 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2% at 26 017.02. The broad-based S&P 500 declined 0.1% to 2 790.51, and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also fell 0.1% to 7 541.49. Stocks with big moves included Best Buy, which surged 14.2% after reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings behind a three percent increase in comparable sales and Mylan, which plunged 13.4% following a disappointing earnings forecast. Analysts were looking ahead to a second day of testimony with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who again adopted a dovish tone on interest rates on Tuesday. In another high-profile hearing, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will update lawmakers on the state of US-China trade talks. An even more closely scrutinised hearing will see President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen publicly discuss the polarising US president's conduct.

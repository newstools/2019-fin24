Eskom has announced it will implement 13 hours of stage 2 load shedding from 09:00 to 22:00 on Monday. "The power system remains constrained following a number of plant breakdowns [Sunday]," said spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe. Stage 2 allows for up to 2000 megawatts to be cut from the national grid. On Sunday the power utility instituted load shedding for the first time since December. It came three days after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that Eskom would be split into three in his State of the Nation Address.

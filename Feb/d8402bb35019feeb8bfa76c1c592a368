African hotel group Onomo Hotels has announced the addition of its second Cape Town property, Signature Lux Waterfront by Onomo, into its portfolio. The design of the 89 contemporary-style rooms has assured the preservation of this Waterfront heritage building. Samantha Annandale, Onomo Group's regional operational director, says the historical integrity of the building is of huge importance to the group. Designer Johan Frank, of the property company Richland Properties, was challenged by keeping the authenticity of the building while transforming it into a hotel. Vivaldi, the hotel's restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner and supports the adjacent Waterfront Theatre School with live performances nightly by musical theatre students from the school. Sitting in the restaurant, one can see the beams of the original warehouse, built in 1901 for German importer Wilhelm Spilhaus. The hotel has also placed a strong focus on servicing tech-lovers and offers self-service kiosks that allow guests to check in and out as the hotel's app incorporates check-in and check-out facilities, mobile key function, and easy reservation, laundry, room service, instant messaging with the front desk, and Wi-Fi dialling services. Televisions in the rooms are set up with Chromecast, which allows guests to screen mirror from their phones to the telescreen. To add to various recent hotel openings in Kigali and Durban, the group is planning openings in Casablanca, Maputo, Douala, Kampala, Tangier and Dar es Salaam.

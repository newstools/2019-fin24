Over 7 800 of Clicks Group employees will share in a R1.5bn payment that has been created through the group's employee share ownership scheme (ESOP). This is in addition to the R1.3bn already paid out under the scheme to beneficiaries in 2018. Vikesh Ramsunder, CEO of Clicks Group, said in a statement this is the final payment of the remaining 50% of shares in the scheme.

Ramsunder explains that 10% of the group's issued shares at the time were placed in the Employee Share Ownership Trust to be allocated to all full-time permanent employees. "Senior black employees, longer serving employees and pharmacists received a higher share allocation." In February 2018, R1.3bn was paid to 7 839 beneficiaries, representing the gain on the first 50% of the shares allocated under the ESOP. The group's CFO and trustee on the ESOP board, Michael Fleming, reported that, "the remaining 50% of the shares allocated to beneficiaries were sold by means of an accelerated bookbuild on 6 February 2019 which was well supported by both international and local investors. The value of the 2018 and 2019 pay-outs will bring the average pay-out per beneficiary of the scheme to R355 000".

Impala Platinum has come out with positive earnings and its price continues to move higher, in what is a very solid uptrend. The good news is there are still significantly higher levels to come. Implats – More upside to come Recommendation: MEDIUM-TERM HOLD/TRADERS BUY Current Trend: Up on all main timeframes. Chart Setup: Implats is
continuing higher, and really accelerating on Thursday after reporting a
turnaround in earnings. It is in a very strong trend and has a higher target
from an inverse head and shoulders pattern (as labelled). Strategy Details: It remains a
medium-term hold (i.e. months).  If not
in, buy on a pullback towards R55. As mentioned in recent weeks and months,
there is huge upside potential in platinum stocks still. Target: The rounding
bottom is targeting line 2 initially at R71. While its further target is R88,
based on the height of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, projected up. (There
is also a shorter-term target of R67). One can take some profits at each level. Stop-loss: It depends on
your time horizon. For the medium-term it’s a close below R41. For short-term
traders it’s a close below R50. (Personally I would like to give it more wiggle
room, due to its large med-term upside potential).

Actress Emma Thompson detailed her reasons for resigning from a Skydance Animation film in protest at its hiring of former Pixar
executive John Lasseter, in a scathing letter that’s one of the most prominent
outcries of Hollywood’s #MeToo era. "If a man has been touching women inappropriately for
decades, why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he’s not
touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must
behave ‘professionally’?" Thompson wrote in the letter, published Tuesday
in the Los Angeles Times with her permission. Lasseter, a longtime senior executive at Walt Disney’s Pixar
animation studio, was dismissed last year following complaints of inappropriate
touching. Skydance Media, led by David Ellison, the son of Oracle billionaire
Larry Ellison, hired Lasseter last month to lead its animation division. The
company said it had vetted him extensively and the executive had "taken
ownership of his behaviour." Two-time Academy Award winner Thompson, who had been cast in
Skydance’s coming animated feature "Luck," started talking about
leaving the production as soon as Lasseter’s hiring was announced, according to
the Times. She withdrew from the film January 20 and sent the letter three days
later, the paper said. "If John Lasseter started his own company, then every
employee would have been given the opportunity to choose whether or not to give
him a second chance," Thompson wrote. "But any Skydance employees who
don’t want to give him a second chance have to stay and be uncomfortable or
lose their jobs. Shouldn’t it be John Lasseter who has to lose HIS job if the
employees don’t want to give him a second chance?" Skydance representatives declined to comment to the Times
about the letter. Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately reach a representative
for Lasseter. Lasseter is one of hundreds of high-profile people publicly
accused of sexual harassment or misconduct since late 2017.

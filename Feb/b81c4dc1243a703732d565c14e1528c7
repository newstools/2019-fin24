Comair [JSE:COM], operator of kulula.com and British Airways in SA, advised shareholders on Friday that it has entered into a full and final settlement agreement with South African Airways (SAA) regarding a case relating to SAA's incentive schemes for travel agents from 14 years ago. Comair had initiated the case against SAA because it was of the view that these incentive schemes for travel agencies were anti-competitive in nature. According to Comair, the scheme was designed to keep travel agents loyal to SAA, therefore, allegedly being in breach of the Competition Act. The scheme was in place from 2001 to about 2006. The Supreme Court of Appeal has now made the settlement agreement between the two airline companies an order of court. According to Comair, in terms of the settlement agreement, SAA will pay Comair a total settlement amount of R1.1bn plus interest as from the end of February until the end of July 2022 - or earlier if SAA elects to do so. In addition, SAA will pay Comair's taxed legal costs incurred to date. Fin24 reported in February 2017 that the South Gauteng High Court had ruled in favour of Comair in the case. In terms of this judgment, Comair was awarded R554m plus interest at 15.5% on this amount, which would have been capped at the value of the award, plus costs, amounting to approximately R1.16bn in total. The matter was then taken on appeal.

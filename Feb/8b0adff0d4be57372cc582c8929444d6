Cabinet has announced that Deputy President David Mabuza will lead a special Cabinet Committee into the state of affairs at Eskom. The committee will be expected to deliver daily reports to President Cyril Ramaphosa on what actions need to be taken "to secure energy supply", it said in a statement. This comes after the utility implemented load shedding for the first time since December this week. During the meeting which took place on Wednesday, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordan briefed Cabinet on the recent spate of load shedding. "These disruptions have had an immeasurable impact on South African households and the economy," the statement said. The special Cabinet committee will include Mabuza, Gordhan, Minister of Energy Jeff Radebe, Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni, Minister of Transport Blade Nzimande, Minister of State Security Dipuo Letsatsi Duba and Police. "The team is expected to meet with all stakeholders to help restore stability to the grid and chart a way forward whilst ensuring that there is minimal economic cost to the consumer and taxpayers," the statement said.

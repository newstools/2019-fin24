Harmony Gold [JSE:HAR] earnings for the six months ended December 31 will be lower compared to the same period in 2017, due, in part, to a R180m loss on its dollar denominated debt. “A translation loss of R180m was recognised on the US dollar denominated debt as at 31 December 2018, compared to a translation gain of R196m recorded in the previous comparable period,” the company said in a trading statement on Friday. Harmony will publish its interim financial results on Tuesday. Earnings per share are expected to decrease to between 6 and 26 South African cents per share, which is between 87% and 97% lower than the previous comparable period.

Gold production for the group was at 751 000oz, a 34% increase compared to the same period in 2017.

It has the potential to contribute approximately 180 000oz per annum, according to Harmony’s production profile.

State-owned airline SAA will not be broken up into three separate entities, but does plan to change its operating model, according to SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali. Tlali was responding to a news headline stating CEO Vuyani Jarana said on Monday the cash-strapped airline will split into three. Tlali told Fin24 this was a misunderstanding.   "The CEO was talking about the operating model of SAA and not about the structure of the business," he said. "We are not looking at a situation of breaking up the airline. SAA as an airline remains, but the manner in which it conducts business will be aimed at bringing in more business and create accountability in terms of operations." * More to come

"Despite significant operational challenges, Airbus continued its production ramp-up and delivered a record number of aircraft in 2018," said Guillaume Faury, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft in a statement. "I am equally pleased about the healthy order intake as it shows the underlying strength of the commercial aircraft market and the trust our customers are placing in us. As we look to further increase our industrial efficiency, we will continue making the digitalisation of our business a key priority." Over the last 16 years, Airbus has steadily increased its production year-by-year with the final assembly lines in Hamburg, Toulouse, Tianjin and Mobile complemented by the addition of the A220 line in Mirabel, Canada, during 2018. A notable contribution to Airbus' delivery increase in 2018 came from the final assembly lines in the US and China. Airbus will report Full Year 2018 financial results on 14 February 2019.

Filings for US unemployment benefits fell last
week to the lowest level since 1969, signaling the labour market
remains tight despite the partial federal-government shutdown. Jobless 



claims declined 13 000 to 199 000 in the week ended January
19, bucking economist forecasts for an increase, Labour
Department figures showed Thursday. The 



four-week average, a
less-volatile measure, decreased to 215 000, the lowest since
early November. Key insights The surprise drop indicates how reluctant employers are to fire workers,
 with the strength overshadowing the shutdown affecting one-quarter of 
the government. In any case, the closure is seen reducing economic 
growth the longer it drags on.

Initial filings by federal employees jumped by about 15 000 to 25 419 on
 an unadjusted basis in the week ended January 12, reflecting the third 
week of the shutdown thatâ€™s caused pay to halt for hundreds of thousands
 of workers. Those figures aren't included in the headline claims 
number, which reflects state unemployment-insurance programs.

Analysts caution that it may take more time for the shutdown to be fully
 reflected in the report, and data on federal employees are reported 
with a lag.

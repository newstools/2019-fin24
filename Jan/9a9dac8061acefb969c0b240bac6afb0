The JSE closed softer on Tuesday along with
other major global indices as pessimism engulfed the markets after the IMF
trimmed its global growth forecasts. The gloomy forecasts reflect what investors
have feared could be the implications of trade wars, Brexit and weaker
corporate earnings. Locally, more evidence has surfaced with regards to the
deteriorating spending power of consumers as Massmart [JSE:MSM] and Shoprite
[JSE:SHP] released relatively weaker sales updates for the last quarter. China
is already taking measures to minimize the impact of low growth on its economy by
through a variety of measures ranging from tax cuts to relaxed corporate credit
lines. On the JSE, the trend was mostly lower
after the major Asian indices closed weaker on Tuesday. In Hong Kong, Tencent
Holdings came under pressure after the company’s games failed to feature on
Chinese regulators’ latest game approval list. The stock closed 1.24% weaker at
$HK335.80 Massmart was the day’s biggest
loser mainly on the back of its trading statement. The stock slumped 20.96% to
end the day at R90.65. Losses in Shoprite were moderate as the stock
shed 0.37% to close at R185.32. Dis-Chem Pharmacies [JSE:DCP] couldn’t catch a
reprieve as it lost another 3.99% to end the day at R25.00, while Clicks
[JSE:CLS] retreated by 0.78% to close at R194.99 despite releasing a relatively
decent trading update. Diversified miner, South32 [JSE:S32] weakened by 2.02%
to close at R32.97, BHP Group [JSE:BHP] lost 1.64% to R283.23, and Glencore
[JSE:GLN] closed 1.36% weaker at R52.32. Of the day’s top gainers, Brait [JSE:BAT]
managed to claw back some of its gains to end the day at R27.50 after adding 4.56%.

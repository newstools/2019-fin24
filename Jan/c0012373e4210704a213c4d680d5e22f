Tesla will cut its full-time employee headcount by 7% with Chief
Executive Officer Elon Musk saying the "road ahead is very difficult"
for the electric-car maker. The shares dropped 5.6% in US pre-market trading. The California-based company managed to eke out a profit in
the fourth quarter, Musk said in a blog post on Friday, but it was lower than
the what the company achieved in the third quarter. Key Insights Tesla will need to produce lower-cost versions of the Model
3 to broaden the car’s appeal to the mass market and as the company starts
international deliveries. The car’s base price is at $35 000 but initial deliveries
have cost $44 000 or more. Moving from last year’s "production hell" for the
Model 3, Tesla got into even choppier waters with Musk’s failed attempt to take
the company private. The larger-than-life CEO agreed to an SEC fine, faced
concerns about his well-being and smoked weed on a US talk show. Tesla’s attempt at getting costs under control comes as
incumbent carmakers too struggle with the high cost of making electric cars. On
top of record investment in new electric-car lineups, high battery costs are
crimping margins and buyers worried about charging and driving range largely
remain on the fence. Market reaction In early US trading, the stock fell about 5.6%.

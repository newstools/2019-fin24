A former insurance company employee has been sentenced for
defrauding 32 clients, he was ordered to pay over half a million to refund
clients. Francois Marinus Labuschagne, former Sanlam financial
advisor, was sentenced by the Bellville Commercial Crime Court on Monday after
being convicted with multiple charges of fraud and forgery, according to a statement
from the Western Cape division of the Hawks. He was arrested in Louis Trichardt, in Limpopo, on January
15, 2017. This followed a six-year investigation into fraudulent activities at
the Ceres Sanlam branch between August 2007 and January 2010, the Hawks said. Labuschagne had defrauded over 32 clients of their savings
which amounted to over R650 000. According to the Hawks Labuschagne convinced
his clients to withdraw a portion and or full benefit from their investment
portfolio and claimed he would reinvest it on their behalf with guaranteed
higher returns, but instead used the funds for "self-gain". Captain Philani Nkwalase told Fin24 by phone that Sanlam had
refunded clients, by deducting R500 000 from Labuschagne's pension. He is to
pay the outstanding balance through instalments. Labuschagne's 10-year sentence was suspended for five years
on the condition that he is not found guilty of similar offences, the Hawks
said. He has also been sentenced 36 months of correctional supervision.

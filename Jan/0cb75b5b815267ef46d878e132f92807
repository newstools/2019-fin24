The Trump administration confirmed it will hold two days of talks this week in Washington to discuss structural changes to China’s economy and Beijing’s pledge to buy more American goods. The US delegation will be led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the White House said Monday. The US group will also include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, Assistant to the President for Economic Policy Larry Kudlow, and Assistant to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro. The Chinese delegation will be led by Vice Premier Liu He.   President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping have given their officials until March 1 to reach a lasting truce to their trade war. The two sides will discuss “structural changes” to China’s economic system, as well as Chinese pledges to buy more US goods and services, according to the White House statement. The talks come at a tense time for US-China relations. US prosecutors are planning to file criminal charges related to Huawei, China’s largest smartphone maker, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. Huawei has been the target of a broad US crackdown over allegations it has stolen trade secrets, violated sanctions against Iran and sold equipment that could be used by the China’s Communist Party for spying.

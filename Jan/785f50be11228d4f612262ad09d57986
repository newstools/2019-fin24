Tharisa [JSE:THA]
has been approved for a secondary listing on A2X Markets and will list on 6
February 2019, the PGM and chrome producer announced on Wednesday. Tharisa's primary
listing is on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and it has a secondary standard
listing on the main board of the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Its issued share
capital will be unaffected by the secondary listing on A2X. Tharisa CEO Phoevos Pouroulis said: "The secondary
listing on A2X is an opportunity to improve liquidity and attract new investors
through the lower trading costs offered by the A2X trading platform." There are no additional regulatory requirements or ongoing
obligations, Pouroulis said, adding: " "Listing on A2X will
complement Tharisa’s existing listings on the JSE and LSE by providing
investors with a choice of exchange on which to transact." Tharisa’s listing will bring the number of companies
available for trade on A2X to 17 with a combined market capitalisation of over
R2trn. A2X includes listings from sectors including mining,
banking, property, FMCG, financial services, insurance and telecommunications.

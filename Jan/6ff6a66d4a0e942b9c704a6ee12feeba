South African Airways (SAA) on Tuesday said it had appointed Vusi Pikoli as Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, in what it described as a significant step in boosting capacity as the troubled airline implements its turnaround strategy. Pikoli is the former National Director of Public Prosecutions at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and current advisor to the minister of state security. SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali said the appointment was "significant in demonstrating our resolve to bringing capacity to strengthen the executive team to execute on our turnaround strategy with much urgency." Pikoli will begin his duties on February 1, reporting to CEO Vuyani Jarana. He will also be responsible for the overall strategic and operational responsibility for the integrated Risk Management Strategy for SAA. 'Disciplined, strong administrator' Tlali further stated that Pikoli "brings a wealth of experience and is known to be a disciplined and strong administrator". The cash-strapped national carrier is implementing its turnaround strategy, which is meant to return the airline to profit and minimise its reliance on the state. The airline said in a statement that it had made cleansing itself of corruption a priority. "We are resolute about our commitment to restore and maintain good governance at required levels at SAA, as this is one of the important enablers for the effective implementation of our turnaround plan," said Tlali.

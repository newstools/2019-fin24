The rally in risk assets faded on Thursday, with Asian stock
indexes trading mixed and the yen recovering, as concerns about rising US-China
tensions offset signs of a better-than-expected start to the earnings season.
The dollar and Treasuries steadied. While shares rose in Japan, gains fizzled in Hong Kong and
China, and US and European futures declined. News of US prosecutors investigating Huawei Technologies for
allegedly stealing trade secrets weighed on sentiment despite strong profits at
Goldman Sachs and Bank of America that buoyed the S&P 500 Index Wednesday. The pound was steady after Prime Minister Theresa May’s
government won a no-confidence vote, as widely expected. Risk assets have been strong in January as optimism about
central bank support overshadows a litany of concerns as the global economy
slows. Bank of America’s Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio further
reassured investors, saying on an earnings call that he’d seen nothing to
suggest an economic slowdown is imminent. Fears of a US recession by 2020 had already been fading,
with the bond market paring back those expectations. "The first quarter is all about relief rallies, that
things aren’t as bad as what was priced in," Binky Chadha, a global
strategist at Deutsche Bank, told Bloomberg TV in New York. Elsewhere, oil traded lower, though US crude remained close
to $52 a barrel. Here are some key events coming up: Earnings season rolls on with Morgan Stanley, Netflix and
Taiwan Semiconductor posting results. Bank Indonesia will probably hold its benchmark at 6%
Thursday, according to all economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Deputy Governor
Masayoshi Amamiya speak at a G-20 event in Tokyo. Data on US jobless claims and industrial production are due. These are the main moves in markets: Stocks Japan’s Topix index rose 0.4% at the 15:00 close in Tokyo.

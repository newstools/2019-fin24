Comair announced on Wednesday afternoon that it had reached a wage settlement with the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa). Comair operates British Airways and kulula.com in SA. According to Wrenelle Stander, executive director of Comair's airline division, the agreement means the threat of a strike has been averted. "Comair and Numsa have worked hard with the guidance of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to find a resolution and we're grateful to all parties for the amicable manner in which these negotiations were held," said Stander. Comair did not supply any further details about the terms of the agreement. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola confirmed to Fin24 on Wednesday afternoon that an agreement had been reached, but also added that at this point she had no further details. Last week negotiations regarding a salary dispute had deadlocked between Comair and Numsa. The dispute related to Comair's 2009 restructure, when certain salary scales were merged. Comair told Fin24 last week that at the time of restructuring, it had decided not to penalise 21 employees by reducing their salaries after the restructure. The salary scales of those 21 employees had differed from colleagues in the bargaining unit. Numsa, in turn, told Fin24 on Friday that it had met with Comair to discuss two disputes. The first was around wage discrepancies and the second related to wage increases. Stander said the 21 "outlier" employees consisted of people across race groups and genders. According to Comair, the salary discrepancies of the 21 "outliers" were in some cases as little as R600, and in only one case was the difference R7 900.

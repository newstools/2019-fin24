President Cyril Ramaphosa will attend and address the 25th Mining Indaba taking place in Cape Town in early February, organisers of the annual gathering announced on Monday. The Investing in African Mining Indaba, which runs from February 4 - 7 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre, is considered the largest annual mining investment event in Africa. It brings together investors, mining groups, government officials and labour. "[Ramaphosa] is expected to address mining industry stakeholders from across the world... and take part in the Mining Indaba’s 25th anniversary, a special event which will celebrate 25 years of progress in African mining," the Mining Indaba said in a statement. Ramaphosa has been talking up the investment potential of the South African mining industry, which has been suffering from job losses and production decreases. At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, the president told potential investors that the publication last year of the reviewed Mining Charter had provided the mining industry much-needed certainty. Mining Indaba director of content Harry Chapman said in a statement that the event plays an important role in helping drive investment into African mining, championing sustainability and creating economic development. "This ties into continental wide themes, particularly in South Africa with President Ramaphosa’s investment drive, so we couldn’t be more excited to be welcoming him to Mining Indaba next week. This will be a fantastic opportunity for delegates to hear about the President’s plans for driving growth and investment in the mining sector in South Africa," said Chapman. The themes for this year’s indaba include resource nationalism, innovations in technology, battery metals, diversity in mining and sustainable development. Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo is also expected to attend the summit to promote Ghana’s investment reform agenda to the mining world, according to the indaba's website.

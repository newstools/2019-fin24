Theresa May is preparing to set out where Brexit goes next after the overwhelming rejection of her deal a week ago. She’s due to present a plan to Parliament on Monday, where members are already working on plans to take control of the process. May will hold a conference call with her Cabinet on Sunday afternoon. Leaked emails show Tory former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has consulted with Parliamentary staff on drafting a motion that would assist in pausing Brexit, according to the Sunday Times. May to brief Cabinet on cross-party talks The prime minister is to hold a conference call with her Cabinet on Sunday afternoon, according to a person familiar with the matter. She’ll update them on her conversations with European Union leaders and on the talks she’s held with members of other parties. For the Cabinet, it will be a chance to see if she’s willing to blur some of her red lines on Brexit, which currently make it hard to see how she can win votes from elsewhere in Parliament. Sunday morning has seen everyone sticking to their existing position. On Sky News, Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab urged May to rule out ending Brexit negotiations, Labour justice spokesperson Richard Burgon said the premier should rule out a no-deal Brexit, and Labour backbencher David Lammy told her to call another referendum. Amid the deadlock, the Sunday Times reports details on how lawmakers are working to take control of the agenda from May. It’s largely as expected, but according to the paper the plans require 300 members of Parliament  less than a majority - to take control of the agenda and start introducing their own legislation. At that point, May could find she’s prime minister in name only.

Airlink will temporarily suspend its air services between
Johannesburg and Mthatha in the Eastern Cape as a result of the downgrading of
the townâ€™s airport by the South African Civil Aviation Authority, Airlink has
said. In a statement issued on its website on Thursday, the
airline said the suspension would be effective from Friday 25 January. "The airport has been downgraded by the SACAA with
immediate effect and as a result is unable to accommodate safe scheduled
passenger air services," the statement said. "We sincerely regret the inconvenience that this
service disruption will cause to our customers, but it is in the interest of
the safety and well-being of our customers, crews and aircraft, which is our
top priority," said Airlink CEO & Managing Director, Rodger Foster. Airlink would work with the Mthatha airport management on a
short-term interim solution in the interests of delivering continued services
to customers, such as deploying smaller aircraft that would be able to operate
safely, Foster added. A further announcement would be made on Friday, Airlink said. Customers were advised to contact their booking agent, SAA
Reservations or Airlink Reservations on 011 451 7350 for refunds or any
assistance with their confirmed reservations, as well as for updated

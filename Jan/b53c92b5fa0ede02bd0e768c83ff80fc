An 85-year-old man has
 become Hong Kong’s biggest victim of a bullion trading scam after being
 conned out of HK$580m ($74m) over two years, according to
 South China Morning Post. The elderly man was one of seven investors who lost a total of nearly
 HK$620m in a scam which involved trading gold on the London 
commodities market, the newspaper 
reported on Friday, citing unidentified people. Hong Kong police 
confirmed the arrest of 14 people related to deception in an emailed 
statement to Bloomberg News, while it declined to comment on the 
specifics about the 85-year-old victim. The so-called "London gold fraud" has been around in Hong Kong for 
many years. According to Hong Kong police website, fraudsters usually 
lure victims into fake precious metal transactions through cold calls. They would then ask victims to deposit money into an investment account 
and sign documents authorising a third party to trade on their behalf. 
Victims eventually find themselves losing all their capital as a result 
of hefty commission and investment losses from frequent transactions. That’s what happened to the 85-year-old man. He received his first 
cold call in the middle of 2016 about trading gold and had made a lot of
 transactions in two years, the newspaper said. Other victims in the 
scam were ethnic Chinese from Taiwan, the US, Australia, Canada and 
New Zealand, according to the report.

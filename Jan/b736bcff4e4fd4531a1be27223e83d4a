Berkshire Partners acquired a stake in Teraco Data Environments, becoming the 
biggest shareholder in Africa’s largest data-centre to capitalise on 
growing demand for internet and cloud-based services on the continent. The Boston-based private-equity firm is sweeping in on 
Johannesburg-based Teraco as technology plays a more integral part in 
the life of consumers and businesses. Teraco was expected to fetch 
between $600m and $1bn, including debt, people familiar 
with the matter said in 
November. "Berkshire Partners is a committed long-term partner that will assist
 us with future growth plans and additional investment," Teraco Managing
 Director Jan Hnizdo in an email. The value of the transaction wasn’t 
disclosed. The purchase comes after London-based Permira, which 
backed a management buyout of the company in 2015, sought a buyer for 
part of its stake in the company, which also operates data centres in 
Cape Town and Durban. Permira will stay on as a shareholder in Teraco, 
Michail Zekkos, a partner in the firm, said. The business plans to double its installed power load capacity to 60 
megawatts in the next four to five years, Teraco’s Hnizdo said. Clients 
include Amazon Web Services and China Telecom Global, its website 
shows. The closely-held company will have spent R4.5bn on building data-services centres in South Africa when the 
current investment cycle ends in 2019.

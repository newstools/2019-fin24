The JSE struggled to maintain its momentum on Thursday as losses in rand hedges and miners weighed on the bourse. Global markets were still reacting to the US Fed's decision to keep rates unchanged as well as the change in its tone from a hiking cycle. The Fed indicated a rather dovish tone on future rate hikes which saw the US dollar weaken significantly against a basket of major currencies. The rand was buoyant on the back of this dollar weakness as it rallied to a session high of R13.23/$. At 17.00 CAT, the rand was trading 0.32% firmer at R13.28/$.

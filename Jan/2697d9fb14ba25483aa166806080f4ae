President Cyril Ramaphosa has said he will wait for the outcomes of all judicial commissions of inquiry to be finalised before deciding whether he should suspend government officials implicated in wrongdoing. The president was speaking to eNCA's Annika Larsen on the sidelines of the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Larsen asked Ramaphosa if he would consider suspending Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane in light of evidence presented to the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture by former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi. Agrizzi accused the minister of accepting monthly bribes. "At the end of it all, we will have a full picture, and once we have a full picture we will then be able to say, 'This now calls for action'," said Ramaphosa. "Let's not deal with the matter on a piecemeal basis." Ramaphosa said he was aware that South Africans wanted to see action "right now", but called for patience. 'My conscience is very clean and clear' The president said that, on his return to SA, he would be meeting with the public protector about the R500 000 donation made by Bosasa head Gavin Watson towards his campaign for ANC President. The controversial donation came to light in late 2018. Ramaphosa said the money had been paid back. "I don’t have anything to hide, I am not even having a sleepless moment… because my conscience is very clean and clear."

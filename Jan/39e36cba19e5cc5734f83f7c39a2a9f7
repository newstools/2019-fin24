The proposed merger of Karan Beef Holdings merger with Karan Beef and Karan Beef Feedlot was approved by the Competition Tribunal on Wednesday with certain conditions. Karan Beef Holdings is a newly incorporated special purpose entity, established for the proposed transaction. Karan Beef is involved in cattle slaughtering, deboning, packaging and selling beef carcasses and cuts. Karan Beef Feedlot purchases calves from breeders and feeds them a special feed until maturity. The Competition Commission, which assesses large mergers before referring them to the Tribunal for a decision, evaluated the proposed merger and recommended that the merger should be approved with conditions aimed at providing a means for historically disadvantaged persons to participate in commercial farming activities.

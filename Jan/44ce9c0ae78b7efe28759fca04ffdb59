A measure of US consumer sentiment fell to the lowest in almost seven months and ratings of the economy deteriorated amid the longest government shutdown in the country’s history. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index declined to 57.4 last week from 58.1 as a gauge of views on the buying climate slid to a 10-week low, according to a report on Thursday. A measure of Americans’ ratings of their personal finances edged up. Key insights While comfort remains elevated after rising to a 17-year high in late September, the measure has been giving up gains as the impasse in Washington idles federal workers. The University of Michigan’s preliminary January consumer sentiment index tumbled to the lowest since October 2016, while the Conference Board’s confidence gauge slumped to a five-month low in December. With no sign of a conclusion soon for the shutdown, evidence is mounting that the closure will take a bigger toll on the economy. White House Council of Economic Advisers chairperson Kevin Hassett said on Wednesday that if the partial government shutdown extends through March, there’s a chance of zero economic expansion this quarter. Barclays cut its first-quarter growth forecast, citing the shutdown: It now sees a 2.5% annualised rate, down from 3%.

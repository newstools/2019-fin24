The Competition Appeal Court of South Africa will hear an appeal against a merger between mining companies Lonmin and Sibanye-Stillwater on April 2. Last year the Competition Tribunal approved a merger between the mining companies subject to certain conditions related to Social Labour Plans and retrenchments. Lonmin CEO Ben Magara had previously said that without the merger, Lonmin would have to retrench about 12 600 workers between 2018 and 2020. The biggest union at Lonmin, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), is against the mergerÂ as it fears job losses. AMCU filed an appeal against the merger with the competition appeal court. Both Sibanye-Stillwater and Lonmin "remain fully committed" to the merger, Sibanye said in its notice.

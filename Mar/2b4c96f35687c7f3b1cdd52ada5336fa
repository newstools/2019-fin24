There is a high risk of load shedding on Thursday but it will only be implemented if "absolutely necessary", says Eskom. In a tweet, the power utility said it would continue to provide regular updates, but did not specify the reason for the increased risk. The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) is due to announce tariff increases for the embattled power utility on Thursday afternoon. If Nersa gives the debt-ridden Eskom the full price increase it has asked for, electricity prices will go up by a whopping 21% from next month. However, Eskom has said even if Nersa gives it the full amount it asked for, it would still make a loss of R20bn for the past financial year. Check yourload shedding schedules here.

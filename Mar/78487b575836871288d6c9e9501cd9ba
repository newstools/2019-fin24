De Beers is having the
 worst start to a year since at least 2016, in the latest sign of 
difficulties plaguing the global diamond industry. De Beers sold just $990m of diamonds in its January and 
February sales, known as sights. That’s the lowest since the Anglo 
American unit started publishing the data in 2016. Sales at the 
start of the year are usually the biggest, as diamond traders and 
manufacturers restock after the holiday season. Diamond miners are struggling across the board, especially those 
producing cheaper and smaller gems where there is too much supply. In 
December, some of Rio Tinto Group’s customers refused to buy cheaper 
diamonds, while De Beers has been forced to cut prices and offer 
concessions to buyers. Diamonds range from giant, flawless stones that sell for millions to 
fragments worth just a few dollars. There’s currently too much supply of
 the cheaper stones, resulting in tiny profits for the companies that 
trade, cut and polish them. De Beers said Tuesday that the bottom end of
 the market remains subdued. There are low to no premiums in the secondary market, where De 
Beers’s customers sell to other traders and manufacturers, which means 
that buyers are struggling to make a profit on their diamonds, according
 to Guy Harari, co-founder of rough-diamond trading platform Bluedax. 
There’s also very little demand for smaller goods, he said. De Beers sells gems at 10 sales a year in Botswana to a select group 
of customers. The buyers are expected to specify the number and type of 
diamonds they want, and then carry out the purchases at a price set by 
De Beers.

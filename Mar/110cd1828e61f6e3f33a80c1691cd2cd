Energy Minister Jeff Radebe removed Luvo Makasi as chairman of the nation’s Central Energy Fund, citing “serious allegations.” Makasi, a director and chairman of the board at the CEF, which oversees South Africa’s state-owned oil company and energy assets, responded to the allegations, the energy ministry said Saturday in a statement without providing details. It didn’t immediately reply to an email seeking comment. “Having considered Mr. Makasi’s written response, the Minister on 15 March wrote to Mr. Makasi, removing him,” the ministry said. Kevin Mileham, the DA's energy spokesperson, said in a statement on Sunday afternoon that he intends to lay charges this week with police in connection with the case. He said he would also present a dossier to the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture, saying the commission has the "top-level investigative power to thoroughly examine what happened". *Update: This article was update with comments made by DA energy spokesperson Kevin Mileham at 15:30 on Sunday, March 17.

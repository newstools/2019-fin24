After years of efforts to make Reebok profitable again,
Adidas Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted has said he’s ready for the next
hurdle - getting more people to actually buy its products. The German company has closed under-performing Reebok stores
and allowed some licensing deals to expire, cutting sales at the long unloved
sporting brand. Meanwhile, it’s spent more on marketing, relative to the
division’s size, than it has for the Adidas label, according to Rorsted. The result: while Reebok’s revenue fell 3% in 2018, its
costs came down even more, and management expects the business to finally start
expanding. "We only have a reason now to grow again," Adidas
Chief Financial Officer Harm Ohlmeyer said at a press conference after the
company forecast a slowdown in overall sales growth that prompted a share
slide. "We needed to grow the profitability, otherwise we were just
digging a deeper hole." More than a decade after its $3.8bn (around R54bn at current rates) acquisition of Reebok,
Adidas as recently as a year ago was contemplating divesting the brand if it
underperformed. Now it’s sticking with it, hoping new footwear lines like the
CrossFit Nano and the FloatRide Run spur sales. Real products "We need to make sure that the brand heat is based on
real products, and that’s something we’re pushing," Rorsted said. Growth won’t come easily. While the brand’s fashion-focused "classics"
line posted double-digit sales gains last year, that momentum was overwhelmed
by a decline in the sports segment. Earlier this week, Dick’s Sporting Goods said it was ending a licensing deal with Reebok. Rorsted batted back the notion that Reebok is a distraction
for Adidas, or that the company’s management team can’t devote enough energy to
both brands to make them thrive. "You love your children equally," he said. "It’s
how you position your brand and how you execute with that brand. This is a
business challenge that all multi-brand companies have."

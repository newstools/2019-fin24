Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe refused to comment on Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan's remarks on Tuesday that Molefe had a lot to answer for in terms of the utility's power crisis. Gordhan, along with Eskom, held a media briefing in Johannesburg on Tuesday on the country's crippling energy supply. During the briefing, he referenced Molefe. Approached for comment, Molefe said he did not watch the Eskom briefing and therefore did not wish to comment. Molefe has previously said that he is in the dark about the current problems facing the power utility. In an interview with eNCA last month, he said he did not want to apportion blame about what could have occurred at the utility he led between April 2015 and November 2016. During the interview, Molefe was asked what went wrong between that period and now, and he responded, "I don't know, because since we have said that three years have passed, and the lights didn't go off and then they went off."I don't know what is happening at Eskom because I am not at Eskom.... I am in the dark," he said. Molefe resigned from Eskom after being named in the State of Capture report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela.

Market regulator the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), has announced it is investigating 13 cases of possible insider trading, 14 of market manipulation and seven of false or misleading reporting at JSE-listed companies. Companies being probed include Steinhoff, EOH Holdings, Resilient REIT and Ayo Technology Solutions, among others. Some are the subject of more than one probe. The regulator is mandated to investigate and take action in cases of abuse of financial markets. On average, an estimated three out of every four cases that the FSCA investigates are closed without action being taken as no contravention is found. In an update earlier in the week the FSCA said that investigations into share trading patterns and complaints should "not be construed as an indication that any violation of a law has occurred, or as a reflection upon any person, entity or security". "The FSCA has the responsibility to investigate these matters in an impartial and objective manner. If no evidence of wrongdoing is uncovered, the investigations are closed."

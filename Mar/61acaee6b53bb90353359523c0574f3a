Despite warnings of a 'high risk' of rotational power cuts, there was no load shedding on Tuesday evening. Eskom had earlier warned in its second power alert of the day of a "high risk" of stage 1 rotational power cuts until 22:00. "[The cuts] will only be implemented if absolutely necessary," it said in a statement. "This is as a result of a shortage of capacity due to the loss of generating units at our power stations". It did not provide further information. Stage 1 load shedding allows for up to 1000 megawatts to be cut from the national grid. In its initial alert at lunchtime the power utility had gauged the likelihood of rotational power cuts as "medium" and urged consumers to turn off all non-essential appliances. The last round of load shedding occurred in February.The debt-laden power utility has not yet instituted rotational power cuts in March. On Monday Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan, chair of the Eskom board Jabu Mabuza and the power utility's CEO Phakamani Radebe met 11 industry specialists who have been appointed as members of its Eskom Technical Review Team. The team, according to a statement, will examine plant unavailability due to scheduled maintenance, plant unavailability due to unplanned outages and unscheduled maintenance and operator errors resulting in power plants tripping and shutting down. It will also probe technical and operator-associated inefficiencies resulting in lower than optimum electricity output from the power station units. The task team is expected to help Eskom improve its plant efficiency and cut down on load shedding, among other things. * Correction: This article originally said there was a high risk of power cuts until 22:00 on Thursday.

 The US National Transportation Safety Board said it’s conducting a safety investigation of a fatal crash involving a Tesla vehicle in Delray Beach, Florida. The NTSB, in cooperation with the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office, is sending three officials to help with the probe, it said on its official Twitter page March 1. A man was killed on Friday after he drove his 2018 Tesla 3 under a tractor-trailer, the Palm Beach Post reported, citing the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office. It wasn’t immediately clear if Tesla’s driver assistance feature known as "Autopilot" was enabled. Tesla declined to comment late Friday.

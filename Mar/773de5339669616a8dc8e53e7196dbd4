The JSE advanced on Friday mainly on the back of broad-based positive sentiment which saw most equity markets trading firmer. The buoyancy in global stocks was triggered by China’s renewed commitment to increase stimulus in its economy. This move is mainly due to the slowdown in China’s economic activity which was highlighted by industrial production data which was released on Thursday. Chinese regulators intend to further cut value-added taxes and incentivise Chinese credit providers to extend loans to businesses. The USA released weaker industrial production numbers on Friday, but this did not dampen the mood for the global stocks as they remained upbeat. Locally, the JSE was lifted mainly by gains which were recorded in the industrials and financials sectors. Pioneer Foods [JSE:PNR] managed to add 8.13% to end the day at R86.50, while Zeder Investments [JSE:ZED] gained 4.62% to end the day at R4.30.

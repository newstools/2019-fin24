Economic activity in 
the eurozone was stronger than expected in February as an improving 
services sector managed to offset a slump in industry. Services expanded across the 19-nation eurozone, bolstered by gains 
in Germany, Ireland and Spain, according to IHS Markit. That pushed a 

composite Purchasing Managers’ Index to 51.9, the highest in three 
months. An initial reading was for an increase to 51.4. There were upward revisions to German and French numbers, and the 
euro pared its decline against the dollar. It was down 0.1% to 
$1.1325 as of 11:09 Frankfurt time. Despite the slight improvement in the figures, IHS Markit said 
readings so far this quarter mean the euro-zone economy could struggle 
to beat the 0.2% expansion seen in last three months. “While the service sector is showing greater resilience, inflows of 
new business remained worryingly weak, providing little hope for any 
noticeable improvement in performance in the coming months,” said Chris 
Williamson, chief business economist. A separate report showed eurozone retail sales rebounded at the 
start of the year, driven by a surge in mail-order and Internet 
business. The data come as European Central Bank officials prepare for their 
policy meeting on March 7. The ECB will probably cut its growth and 
inflation projections, and there’s speculation whether persistently weak
 data will warrant new stimulus or a change in plans to raise interest 
rates. While there have been reports of rising wage pressures recently -
encouraging signals for policy makers struggling to lift inflation - 
weaker demand in manufacturing is causing a slowdown in input costs as 
well as output charges. Business confidence improved in February despite slowing global 
growth, rising geopolitical concerns and risks including trade wars, 
Brexit and tightening financial conditions.

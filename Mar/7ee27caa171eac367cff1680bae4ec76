Meituan Dianping is reaping the benefits of scale in its
core food delivery division as it feels the pain of competition from arch-foe
Alibaba in smaller businesses such as hotel bookings. While revenue almost doubled in the December quarter, its
net loss widened 57% to 3.4bn yuan ($508m) as profitability shrank in travel
and bike-sharing. To keep a lid on swelling costs, Meituan said it’s kicked off
a restructuring that will see loss-making bike-rental subsidiary Mobike pull
out from most of its overseas markets. Backed by WeChat-operator Tencent, Meituan is
spending heavily to wage a pitched battle with Alibaba’s Ele.me and Fliggy in a
cut-throat arena for on-demand services. That’s taken a toll on its bottom line
and share price, which is down 15% since the company raised $4.2bn in a 2018
initial public offering. Billionaire founder Wang Xing pledged to ramp up cost
discipline as the growth of its bread-and-butter meal delivery business begins
to subside. "Growth is decelerating. The industry will continue a
modest growth rate in 2019," the chief executive officer told analysts on
a conference call. The company will be "more disciplined and selective as
to where and when to allocate capital." Meituan intends to focus on food-related initiatives – such
as restaurant management – that can augment and complement its core business,
Wang said. And it will keep trying to reduce losses by curbing
subsidies in areas such as car-hailing and bike-sharing. Its hotel business,
which goes up against Alibaba’s Fliggy, is already profitable, he added. "New initiatives dragged down overall margins because
of gross losses incurred in car-hailing, bike-sharing, and restaurant
management," said Vey-Sern Ling, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "That could be due to competitive pressures, which
required Meituan’s response in higher subsidies." * Fin24's parent company Media24 is part of the Naspers Group. Naspers owns a stake in Tencent.

Transnet announced on Friday afternoon that it has suspended four executive committee members with immediate effect. "Transnet is a business in transition. The primary aim being to restore confidence and deliver on our mandate. We therefore need to be deliberate about improving our corporate governance and establish leadership - informed by principles of integrity and accountability," Transnet said in a statement. "The journey also involves taking difficult decisions with the view to restoring confidence on Transnet. To this end, four of our executive committee members have been suspended, effective today." The following executives suspended on Friday are: Transnet said it is of the view that their continued presence in the workplace has the potential to jeopardise investigations into their alleged misconduct. "Given the position they occupy it is almost impossible to investigate the allegations while they are at work. It is in the best interest of Transnet that they be placed on suspension on full pay with full benefits," Transnet said in the statement."Transnet encourages all employees to work together to make Transnet great again. Our engagements need to be based on principles of service and integrity so that we are able to deliver upon our mandate to South Africa."

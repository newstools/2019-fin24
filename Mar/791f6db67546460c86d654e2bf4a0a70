The JSE inched higher on Tuesday, mainly on the back of gains recorded among JSE-listed miners. Platinum group metals miners on the advanced as palladium surged to briefly break above $1600/Oz, peaking at $1601.52/Oz. Other metal commodity prices, such as gold, were also firmer on the day. This helped the Resources index to close among the day’s biggest gainers. Sentiment across Europe and the USA was also bullish as market participants anticipate a more dovish stance from the US Fed’s policy statement on Wednesday, which will incentivize investors to seek riskier assets such as stocks.

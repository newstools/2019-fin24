Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has ruled that former finance minister Des van Rooyen can cross-examine ex-Treasury director general Lungisa Fuzile at the state capture inquiry. Van Rooyen was surprisingly appointed finance minister by former president Jacob Zuma in December 2015. The unexpected decision sent shock waves across markets and the rand into a tailspin. His appointment was rescinded days later with Pravin Gordhan taking over the portfolio. Zondo said on Thursday that a date for the cross-examination will be announced at a later stage. During his testimony in 2018, Fuzile said that Van Rooyen arrived at the National Treasury with a "pre-appointed adviser" in Mohamed BobatÂ who tried to give Treasury staff instructions. On Thursday, Zondo also said Van Rooyen had been given the green light to give evidence himself before the commission.

JSE-listed IT group 4Sight – which on Monday made headlines when a board member stepped down amid accusations of 'Trumpism' among executives – saw its board chair step down with immediate effect on Tuesday. Board chair Rama Sithanen's resignation was announced in the early evening. Sithanen stepped down due to his intention to re-enter politics in Mauritius, according to a statement by 4Sight posted on the JSE news service on Tuesday evening. He advised the board of his intention to resign later in the year, "but the current situation within the group has led him to resign earlier than expected," the statement said. "The resignation of Dr Sithanen earlier than anticipated is regrettable and he has served the Board in an ethical, constructive and professional manner, providing sound guidance and wisdom. The remaining Board members thank him for his dedicated service in trying times and wish him all the best for the future," it added. 4Sight is headquartered in Mauritius and listed on the JSE. It provides autonomous and artificial intelligence solutions, including machine learning and big data. On Monday, the company announced the resignation of Geoffrey Carter, chair of its audit and risk committee, also with immediate effect. The announcement cited "false accusations" within emails allegedly sent by executives as the reason for Carter's resignation. According to the statement, the accusations were "delusional in content, incorrect in law" and amounted to "'Trumpism strategy' – attack is the best form of defence and rule by division." The statement added that the emails were "incomprehensible, apparently personal and diabolical". The individuals who allegedly sent the emails were not named. On Tuesday, 4Sight closed 4c higher on 20c.

International foodservice group Bidcorp announced on
Wednesday that it is selling off its UK-based food logistics business. Bidcorp operates across five continents in both developed
and emerging markets. In a notice to shareholders it stated that it entered
into a contract for the disposal of UK-based Best Food Logistics. Best Food Logistics is non-core asset of Bidcorp's, the
group said. The transaction is subject to approval of competition authorities
in the UK, and could take several months to finalise. "There will be no material financial impact on
Bidcorp's consolidated net assets or profit for the year ending June 30, 2020
as a result of the transaction," the notice read. Best Food Logistics has been classified as a discontinued operation
in the 2019 financial results, which were released earlier this year in August.

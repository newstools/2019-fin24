Newly launched SA Harvest, a non-profit company, wants to eliminate hunger and food waste through education, and by the rescuing and re-distribution of quality surplus food. According to a statement issued by SA Harvest, it is estimated that 10 million tonnes of the food produced in SA goes to waste annually â€“ costing the country in excess of R72bn. SA Harvest is based on the Australian model called OzHarvest, which was started by ex-South African entrepreneur Ronni Kahn in 2004. The model is also being replicated in the UK Thailand and New Zealand. SA Harvest is based on four pillars: Food rescue SA Harvest uses refrigerated vehicles to collect and deliver perishable and non-perishable foods, enabling their recipient organisations to get sufficient variety to provide full and nourishing meals to their people. Education This is a critical arm of the business, according to SA Harvest CEO Alan Browde. "We are able to raise awareness about food waste, food rescue, and food security and nutrition through sustainable and appropriate educational programmes and technologies that, inter alia, help people to become food self-sufficient," he explains. Engagement This means working together with communities to reduce their food waste and alleviating hunger in their midst and together creating successful and sustainable solutions. Innovation SA Harvest is constantly looking for innovative solutions to combat food waste and hunger in South Africa. Another benefit, in its view, is the protection of the environment through reducing global warming, by ensuring that good food is eaten rather than going to landfill.

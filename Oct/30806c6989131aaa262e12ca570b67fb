The JSE was adrift on Friday as it traded
mostly flat in line with other global markets which struggled for direction. Markets in Asia did have some direction
primarily on the back of weaker than expected Chinese GDP numbers which fell to
a 30-year low of 6.0% QoY. This resulted in the Shanghai Composite Index
closing 1.42% weaker while the Hang Seng lost 0.48%. The Japanese Nikkei eked
out gains of 0.18%. Stocks in Europe and the USA were mixed as investors tried
to gauge events with Brexit, United States corporate earnings and weaker Chinese economic
data. Emerging market currencies edged higher on
the day primarily on the back of a weaker greenback. The rand advanced to a
session high of R14.74/$ before it retreated to trade 0.13% firmer at R14.80/$. On the JSE, Intu Properties [JSE:ITU] came
under significant pressure following the reduction of its stock rating to
reduce by HSBC Bank. The stock eventually closed 5.08% lower at R8.96.
Healthcare provider Netcare [JSE:NTC] lost 3.89% as it closed at R17.77, while
its sector peer Mediclinic [JSE:MEI] retreated 2.23% to close at R71.97.
Despite the rand holding steady rand sensitives retreated on the day. Mr Price
[JSE:MRP] lost 1.25% to close at R158.74, while Truworths [JSE:TRU] dropped 2.49%
to close at R51.79. On the financials sector, FirstRand [JSE:FSR] fell 1.89% to
close at R65.99, while Standard Bank [JSE:SBK] dropped 1.44% to close at R179.20.  Losses were also recorded for Imperial Logistics [JSE:IPL] which lost 1.95% to
close at R52.81, while Telkom [JSE:TKG] closed at R68.22 after losing 1.67%. Miners recorded most of the day's gains on

The JSE closed firmer on Thursday as it shrugged off news that Chinese officials are casting doubts about reaching a comprehensive long-term trade deal with the US. This contrasted with the trend in Europe and the USA were stocks retreated on the back of these news. The local bourse seemed to take a leaf from the Nikkei and the Hang Seng which closed 0.37% and 0.9% higher respectively.

Caixin’s release of Chinese manufacturing PMI data which is expected on Friday.

payrolls numbers as well as its ISM manufacturing PMI numbers. Locally, Statistics SA released producer

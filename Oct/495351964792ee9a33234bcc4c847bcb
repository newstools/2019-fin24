Eskom's load shedding schedule announced Wednesday will extend to Zimbabwe, the country's power utility the Zimbabwe Electricity Distribution Company has said. In a tweet, ZETDC said: "The Eskom alert will affect power imports. As such load shedding will be implemented at Stage 2 today." Zimbabwe has been importing power from Eskom, but under the 400MW deal non-firm exports are reduced to zero and firm exports (50MW) are reduced proportionally in accordance to the load shedding stage. South Africa power utility Eskom instituted Stage 2 load shedding on Wednesday, starting at 9:00. The national rotational power outages could last until 23:00. Eskom said it was experiencing a "shortage of capacity", and that more details would follow. It later added that rotational power cuts were due to a broken conveyor belt at Medupi, boiler tube leaks and low dam and diesel levels. Eskom warned last month that plant maintenance which often takes place during the summer time may trigger outages.

The JSE took a leaf from the Asian markets
trading session as it closed firmer on Wednesday. This contrasted with trends in Europe and
the USA where stocks eased from prior session highs as doubts started to creep
in over Brexit and US earnings. In the USA this was made worse by a
contraction in retail sales data for the month of September. Statistics SA also released South Africa’s
retail sales data for the month of August which came in lower than forecasted. Retail sales year-on-year only rose by 1.1%
which missed the estimated expansion of 2.6%, while retail sales MoM contracted
by 0.9% which was worse than the forecasted contraction of 0.1%. The rand came under pressure overnight as
it breached R15/$ to peak at a session low of R15.05/$. The local currency was
recorded trading 0.57% weaker at R14.96/$ at 17:00. On the local bourse, EOH Holdings [JSE:EOH]

Rhodes Food Group [JSE:RFG] surged 14.12% to close at R16.00. Listed property stocks tracked mostly higher

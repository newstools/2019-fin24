Former acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko has apologised to ANC leader Gwede Mantashe's daughter Nombasa Mawela, a year and ten months after alleging at a disciplinary hearing that she was a beneficiary of corruption. In November 2017 the then-suspended Eskom executive alleged that Mawela, and others, had been involved in corruption. Koko resigned fromÂ  Eskom in February 2018. Mawela lodged a R500 000 defamation lawsuit against Koko in 2018 over the claims he made, according to TimesLive. On Sunday on Twitter Koko retracted the corruption allegation in a series of tweets, saying he apologised to Mawela for "any harm to her reputation suffered as a result of these allegations".  The former Eskom acting CEO has himself been the subject of allegations of corruption, which he has denied. In March, at the ongoing judicial commission of inquiry into state capture, a coal supply unit manager at Eskom said that in 2015, he twice received phone calls from Koko instructing him to accept that sub-standard coal be forwarded to Majuba power station. Koko told Fin24 at the time that he had not instructed the manager to accept sub-standard coal, saying "people are under pressure to implicate others to justify state capture,"

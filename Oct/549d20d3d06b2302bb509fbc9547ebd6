Doctors in Zimbabwe are continuing to strike, defying a government order to return to work. They have rejected a 60% pay rise, saying it is not enough to keep up with soaring prices. But with the economy in free fall, patients needing treatment are also suffering. The strike is the latest in a string of economic challenges faced by cash-strapped Zimbabwean consumers, who are now paying 26% more for fuel and 300% more for energy, Fin24 recently reported. Filling up a tank will now cost a full month's salary for some. President Emmerson Mnangagwa recently described the economy as "dead".

Thirty-five years of experience has equaled more than R9.4m at the annual Nedbank Cape Winemakers Guild Auction. The Auction was held at Spier Wine Estate in Stellenbosch recently and produced a total turnover exceeding R9.4m with an average price per case (6 x 750ml) of R4 873 and an average price per bottle of R812. "The ongoing demand for South African wines over the past 35 auctions is a good indication of the quality wines our winemakers continue to produce. South African wines are comfortably competing on the international market, and this is evidenced by the increasing number of new buyers participating in the auction year on year," says Boela Gerber, chair of the Cape Winemakers Guild. "Our auction wines represent the top growing regions within the Western Cape, and our Guild members are some of the most innovative and creative winemakers in the country." Created in small volumes, each wine on auction has withstood the scrutiny of a panel of Guild members and is put forward for auction based on its distinction. The highest average prices per case for red wine went to Kanonkop CWG Paul Sauer 2016 (R11 525), Boekenhoutskloof Syrah Auction Reserve 2017 (R8 900), Hartenberg CWG Auction Shiraz 2016 (R8 488). Top achieving white wines based on an average price per case included Leeu Passant Radicales Libres 2014 (R6 979), Ataraxia Under the Gavel Chardonnay 2018 (R5 059) and Jordan CWG Chardonnay 2018 (R4 524). The average price per case for Méthode Cap Classique was R3 995 for Silverthorn Wines Big Dog V 2014 and R3 073 for Graham Beck Agrafe Fermented and Crown Cap Fermented MCC 2014. The only port-style wine, Boplaas Cape Vintage Auction Reserve 2016 sold for an average price of R3 256 per case. The bulk of the wine, 71%, was purchased by local buyers with 29% bought by foreign bidders. The countries represented included the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Denmark, Luxembourg, Belgium, Hong Kong, Germany, Mauritius, USA, Czech Republic, Namibia, Dubai, Australia and France. The auction is only the culmination of the Guild’s work. Their ongoing efforts to promote transformation and innovation in the winemaking industry have yielded a number of youth programmes. The Protégé Programme is one such programme that gives aspirant winemakers the opportunity of working alongside and being mentored by members of the Guild, during a three-year internship, and aims to develop the next generation of Guild members.

Wage
negotiations in the private security sector remain deadlocked and unions are
heading to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration to
declare a dispute, they said in a statement on Thursday. Previous
negotiations failed when employers offered a 1.1% wage hike, which the unions
said they rejected outright because in real terms it translated to 23c per hour
for Grade C officers, the lowest paid category. During
a compulsory mediation process on 1 and 2 October, the offer was hiked to 5%,
but this too has been rejected. The nine
unions with seats on the national bargaining council – among them Detawu and
Satawu – said they were holding out for R7 500 for Grade C officers,
R8 000 for Grade B and R8500 for Grade A officers. Security
officers in these grades are currently paid R4 377, R4 981 and R5 558
respectively. They have also requested benefits such as subsidised hospital
cover. If the CCMA fails to resolve the mutual interest
dispute declared between the unions and employers, a certificate will be issued
to take workers on strike. Fin24
previously reported that both unions and employers had been doubtful the
initial mediation process would deliver results. Fidelity CEO Wahl Bartmann said
there was a large difference between what employees were demanding and what the
South African National Security Employers' Association (SANSEA) was prepared to
offer. The
private security industry in South Africa employs some half a million officers,
compared to under 200 000 police officers, Fin24 also
reported. Compiled by Marelise van der Merwe

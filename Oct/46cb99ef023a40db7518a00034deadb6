A Chinese company received a contract to help establish the
first commercial Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facility in the country. Local group Renergen [JSE:REN] announced yesterday that Western Shell
Cryogenic Equipment (WSCE) of China will be involved in establishing the Virginia
Gas Project, which will produce LNG and liquid helium.  According to the company, the
natural gas at the Free State field contains one of the richest helium
concentrations recorded globally. The natural gas is also very pure with an
average of over 90% methane. The plant is expected to be operational within the first
half of 2021 and will see the plant produce up to 2,700 GJ of liquid natural
gas and 350 kg of liquid helium per day. WSCE will supply the technology and equipment for the plant,
which will be built in part by local engineering group EPCM Bonisan. Renergen says WSCE has been manufacturing small scale LNG
plants since 2004, and helped to build a liquid helium system for the Beijing
Positron-Electron Collider in China. The Virginia plant will be “modularised”: constructed in sizes
of standard shipping containers for ease of transport and installation on site.
The design uses mixed refrigeration cycle for the liquefaction process of the
natural gas, which means the energy consumption is very low as compared to
other plants at this small scale, Renergen says. An agency of the United States government has agreed to lend Renergen more than R600 million to build the Virginia plant.

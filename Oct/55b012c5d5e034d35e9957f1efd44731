Stellenbosch University (SU) announced on Sunday that it will be bringing its Business School (USB) back to Stellenbosch where it will find a new home to be developed on a part of the Oude Libertas site. The USB is currently situated on a campus in Bellville, Cape Town. SU's council recently accepted the donation of a part of the Oude Libertas land outside Stellenbosch from Distell. In a statement, Distell said the company is very supportive of initiatives that have the potential to bring fundamental change and improved opportunity in Stellenbosch. SU Rector and Vice-Chancellor Prof Wim de Villiers said recent market analysis, current competitors' trends and SU's vision for the USB made a compelling case for relocating to Stellenbosch. The new site, which will accommodate the USB and the executive development company USB-ED as well as the Institute for Futures Research, is strategically located within the planned redevelopment of the Adam Tas Corridor (ATC), an area stretching along the R310 and R44 along the foot of Papegaaiberg, from the disused Cape Sawmills site in the west to Kayamandi and Cloetesville in the north. According to De Villiers, the SU will mainly fund the development out of fundraising activities which will be the determining factor for this move to take effect. Apart from funding, the relocation will be subject to normal approval and public participation processes, as well as consultation with affected stakeholders. The existing campus in Bellville will continue to function with expanded activities from other university departments.

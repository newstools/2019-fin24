The JSE retreated on Monday primarily on
the back of losses recorded on the resources index. The firmer rand played an important role as
it extended its gains against the greenback. This saw rand-denominated prices of metal
commodity prices fall which resulted in weakness for most of the locally listed
miners. The JSE also shrugged off earlier momentum
from Chinese markets which rallied on the optimism of a partial trade deal. The rand held on to its gains as it peaked
at a session high of R14.72/$ before it was recorded trading 0.01% firmer at
R14.79/$ at 17:00. On the local bourse, Kumba Iron Ore
[JSE:KIO] came under significant pressure as it tumbled 6.09% to close at R364.50,
African Rainbow Minerals [JSE:ARI] lost 3.76% to close at R140.59, and Glencore
[JSE:GLN] fell 2.94% to end the day at R43.18. Imperial Logistics [JSE:IPL] also struggled

fell 2.28% to close at R359.34, while its sector peer BHP Group closed at R312.74 after losing 2.33%. Some rand sensitives also weakened despite

R157.28, Investec PLC [JSE:INP] retreated 2.56% to close at R78.50, and Massmart

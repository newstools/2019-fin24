The SA Revenue Service says its suspended chief officer of human capital and development has resigned with immediate effect, several weeks after being suspended. Teboho Mokoena was placed on precautionary suspension at the end of July, along with the tax agency's chief officer of governance, Hlanganani Mathebula, and its chief officer of employee relations, Luther Lebelo. In a statement on Friday, SARS said that after extensive discussions it had agreed with Mokoena that his term of employment would come to an end "with immediate effect". "SARS will not proceed with further actions against Mr Teboho Mokoena in pursuance of allegations against him. SARS wishes him well in his future endeavours," it added.Â The agency did not say what Mokoena had been accused of. At the time of Mokoena's precautionary suspension in late July, SARS said it was acting to clean up the agency in response to the release of the final report of the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance by SARS, also known as the Nugent Report. The commission of inquiry, chaired by retired Judge Robert Nugent, found that good governance standards plummetted under the agency's former commissioner Tom Moyane, which in turn depressed revenue collections.

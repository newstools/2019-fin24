The costs of upkeep, levies, construction and transport at Cape Town's three Parliamentary villages was R363m over the five years of the 5th term, according to the department of public works. The fifth Parliament started in May 2014 when Jacob Zuma was elected president, and ended in May 2019 when new MPs were sworn in. Because Parliament is located in Cape Town, a two-hour flight from the administrative capital in Pretoria, MPs are housed in three Parliamentary villages in the Mother City when Parliament is in session. As of late December 2018, they had a total of 666 housing units managed by department of public works.  A majority of the units - 493 - are located at Acacia Park, with 65 at Laboria Park and 108 at Pelican Park. In late 2018, 224 housing units are occupied by MPs at Acacia Park, 55 at Laboria Park and 63 at Pelican Park. Ministers and the president have separate accommodations. DA MP Willem Frederik Faber asked the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure Patricia de Lille how much was spent for the upkeep and management of the three villages over the five years. In total, the cost to government was R363.1m. This includes: Laboria Park    R12.1m Pelican Park     R22.3m Acacia Park      R50.9m Acacia Park      R113.7m Laboria Park     R21.1m Pelican Park     R27.6m

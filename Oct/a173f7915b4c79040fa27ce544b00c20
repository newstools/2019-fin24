The JSE bucked the trend in other global markets as it surged to close firmer on Monday. With Chinese markets closed for a holiday there was little sentiment that filtered through from Asian trading.  European stocks traded moderately firmer although there was disappointment stemming from German factory orders data which contracted by 0.6% month-on-month in September. In the US, sentiment was rather pessimistic on the back of concerns over the extent of the Federal Reserve's policy easing and the possibility of a deal at the next round of Sino-US trade talks. Emerging market currencies struggled on the day, relinquishing some of the gains made towards the end of last week.

Wiese is the biggest shareholder in Brait, which owns Premier Foods, Virgin Active and the UK retailer Iceland. It also owns the struggling UK clothing group, New Look. Brait's share price has halved over the past year as it wrote down the value of New Look - which it bought for more than R14 billion in 2015 - to zero As part of this week's transaction, Titan and Mergence now own 46.3% of Brait and have entered into a voting pool arrangement. Titan remains in control of the voting pool and views Brait "as a strategic long-term investment". Mergence will propose a nominee to the board of Brait and says it will pursue a strategy to strengthen the balance sheet of Brait, amend the current advisory contract, reduce costs and pursue the sale of assets to maximise value for shareholders. But Titan denied media reports  that it was planning to dispose of all of Brait's assets except gym-chain Virgin Active, and remove the current management.

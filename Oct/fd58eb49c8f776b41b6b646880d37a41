Apple has hit back at Google security experts who claimed to have uncovered an 'indiscriminate' hacking operation that targeted iPhones over a period of at least two years and used websites to implant malicious software to access photos, user locations and other data. In a news release, Apple said Google's findings created a false impression about the attacks. The tech company said the hackings were narrowly focused, targeting a small number of websites that provide content related to Uighur Muslims, a minority group in in China. A recent report also said Chinese officials placed spyware apps on phones belonging to Uighur Muslims as part of a surveillance campaign.

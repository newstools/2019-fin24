The Financial Sector Conduct
Authority (FSCA) has fined Metropolitan
Collective Investments (METCI) R100 million after one its unit trust lost two-thirds
of its value in half a week. The Third Circle MET Target
Return Fund lost 66% of its value from December 8 to 11 in 2015. The
losses came amid a period of massive volatility in South Africa, ahead of the shock replacement of finance minister Nhlanhla Nene with the ANC unknown Des van Rooyen. The FSCA found that METCI did
not have proper risk management processes in place to manage and exercise
proper control, oversight and governance over the fund. It also found that the
extent of the fund’s exposure to derivatives was contrary to the prescripts of
the relevant financial sector laws as well as the fund’s own investment policy
statement and mandate. METCI, which is part of Momentum Metropolitan Holdings, was
also found to have published misleading statements in certain minimum
disclosure documents (MDDs) for the fund. Over that period, the fund was almost wholly invested in derivatives. This,
the authority found, was misleading as the MDDs did not disclose the nature of
the Fund as well as risks associated with the Fund. Moneyweb
reported on Wednesday that Momentum Investments will appeal the decision.

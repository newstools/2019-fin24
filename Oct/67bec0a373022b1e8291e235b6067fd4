has been facing a myriad of challenges including 18-hour power outages. It is
also experiencing a crippling cash crisis for both local and foreign currency, resulting in Zimbabweans having to buy cash from parallel
markets at a huge premium. In his State of the Nation Address (SONA) presented on Tuesday, Mnangagwa said he was aware of the
challenges being faced by Zimbabweans but pleaded for patience. "I'm
aware of the pain being experienced by the poor and the marginalised. "Getting
the economy working again from being dead will require time, patience, unity of
purpose and perseverance," said Mnangagwa. Cartels He also
expressed concern over what he called the emergence of cartels that are stifling
competition and engaging in unjustified price hikes. "While
government will not revert to price controls, we are nonetheless, in the
process of reviewing the Competition Act in order to introduce deterrent penalties
to combat such business malpractices." On the
cash crisis, Mnangagwa said the exchange rate is being manipulated by economic
saboteurs. "Last
weekâ€™s events of exchange rate manipulation, amounts to economic sabotage and
should not be tolerated." Power utility On

efficiency. He
added that "to address this state of affairs, we have now restored the
cost reflective electricity tariff structure and increased power imports to
provide the much needed short-term relief."

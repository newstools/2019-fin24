WiT (Web in Travel) is bringing its event to Africa with the launch of WiT Africa in Cape Town in May 28, 2020. “The time has come for Africa in the online travel space,” said WiT founder Yeoh Siew Hoon. “The rest of the world is excited about African opportunities and the dynamism of the region echoes what we have experienced in many of Asia’s emerging markets – fragmented, diverse, connected and full of promise – and we look forward to learning how the industry is changing and growing on the continent.” WiT, which has been running its signature conference in Singapore since 2005, also runs editions in South Korea (Seoul); Japan and North Asia (Tokyo) as well as Middle East (Dubai). “With our roots in Asia, we understand the characteristics of emerging markets and the headroom for growth with a young, urban, rising middle class demographic – often highly social, highly mobile – and we are excited to connect the dots between what is happening in Africa with Asia, and see if there are lessons to be learnt for mutual gain,” said Yeoh. WiT events focus on how technology is changing customer behaviour and how travel companies have to evolve and adapt. It’s known for championing innovation and fostering start-up ecosystems by bringing start-ups and investors together and for building bridges between regions and global markets. Its content typically blends global oversight and expertise with local insights to ensure its relevance to local players. WiT is making its African debut with three Foundation Sponsors: Travelstart, Wego and Cleartrip. WiT Africa, to be held at the Belmond Mount Nelson Hotel, is expected to attract up to 200 delegates who can expect to learn about how rapid digitisation is creating choice and affordability for a diverse set of customers, and how they must adapt.

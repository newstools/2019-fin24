In protest against government’s plan to divide Eskom into
three units, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is threatening to strike in an effort to trigger country-wide blackouts. “It is the only weapon that we have as a trade union,” NUM
president Joseph Montisetsi said in an interview with SAfm on Thursday morning. NUM reportedly has
15,000 members who are Eskom employees, while
it also has a large number of coal mineworkers, who could also strike and
disrupt deliveries to power stations. On Tuesday, public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan
announced that Eskom will be divided into three arms - distribution,
transmission and generation – which will all remain functional subsidiaries of
an Eskom holding company, but with separate boards and CEOs. Transmission will be the first to be separated out, but
it will remain a Eskom holding company. Montisetsi objects against the creation of three new boards,
with three CEOs, which will increase costs. This will mean that the Eskom group will have four boards - for the three units plus the holding company. He said that this will add to Eskom's cash flow crisis, which was caused by the “Guptas (who) came in and ripped off Eskom”. “Boards are not for mahala. This is
unfair.” Glencore Meanwhile, NUM members
will march to Glencore’s offices in Witbank on Friday. NUM is accusing the mining
and commodity trading giant of unfair dismissal of workers, as well as
neglecting to providing workers with good housing and living conditions "If
nothing positives come out of this peaceful march tomorrow the NUM will
mobilise its members in the whole province of Mpumalanga to embark on a
full-blown strike. The union is perturbed by how Glencore treats NUM members
and workers in general," said Tshilidzi Mathavha, NUM Highveld Regional
Secretary. Fin24
has contacted Glencore, a key coal provider for Eskom, for comment.

The JSE closed weaker for a second consecutive session as global markets remained subdued due to weak economic data. Weaker services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data was recorded across most of the European countries, which released the data with notable declines for the UK and Germany.  Given the recent weakness in manufacturing PMI data from the US, investors now shifted their attention to the release of the ISM non-manufacturing PMI which came in significantly weaker at 52.6 compared to a forecast of 55.1. US factory orders contracted by 0.1% which mildly beat the forecast of -0.5%. On the JSE, Assore [JSE:ASR] closed amongst the day's biggest losers as it lost 5.58% to close at R246.92 despite thin volumes exchanging hands.Rand hedges struggled on the day with losses being recorded for Sappi [JSE:SAP] which lost 4.04% to close at R36.60, Mondi PLC [JSE:MNP] which lost 3.08% to close at R281.50, and British American Tobacco [JSE:BTI] which closed at R523.77 after losing 2.25%. Luxury goods retailer Richemont [JSE:CFR] weakened by 1.99% as it closed at R104.50, and oil producer Sasol [JSE:SOL] lost 2% to close at R251.02.

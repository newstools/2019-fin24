The JSE-listed ICT group Datatec [JSE:DTC], in a brief trading update on Thursday, says it expects a boost in headline earnings per share (HEPS) in the the first half of the financial year after a "solid operational performance". The group is set to announce its full interim results for H1 FY20 on October 17. It said it expects HEPS to grow to between 2 and 2.5 US cents in the six months to end August 2019. In the corresponding previous period, HEPS was 0.7 US cents.  "All of the group's divisions delivered strong results, with the reshaping of Westcon International and associated central cost reductions proceeding according to plan," it said. The group sold off its US business Westcon Americas to Synnex in September 2017. The company's share price was 1.5% higher at R33.61 a share in early trade.

The Green Building Council of South Africa (GBCSA) has awarded a 6-Star Green Star SA Existing Building Performance (EBP) rating for Hotel Verde Cape Town - often referred to as Africa's greenest hotel. This puts the hotel at "World Leadership" status according the to the GBCSA's certification tools.  Dorah Modise, CEO of GBCSA, says, "the EBP rating is achieved through assessing the environmental performance of any existing building in operation - items such as energy and water monitoring, management policies and plans are required in order to achieve the rating". Modise adds that the evaluation also addresses the relationship between landlord and tenants, but that the focus is on making the operations and management of the building efficient in order to maintain optimal performance. Mario Delicio, founder of Verde Hotels and a passionate advocate of sustainability, said how fitting it was to be awarded this prestigious accolade whilst celebrating their sixth year in hospitality and sustainability. "I am immensely proud of the team at Hotel Verde Cape Town Airport – this is a phenomenal achievement - everyone's input, ever-improving performance and a passion for operating green hotels has resulted in the ultimate reward. May we continue to grow, contribute and prosper in all things sustainable," he concluded. Hotel Verde Cape Town Airport showcases some of the most advanced, environmentally-conscious technological installations and construction methods in addition to procurement and operational practices in the world. Verde Hotels remains committed to growing a portfolio of luxury green hotels and green buildings in Africa, and around the world.

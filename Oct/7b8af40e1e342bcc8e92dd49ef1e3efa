The JSE firmed on Tuesday on the back of
broad-based optimism fueled by positive news for Brexit and United States earnings. With the US earnings reporting season
having kicked off today following the release of earnings from some of the
major banks, investors shifted their focus to the health of the US companies. With the Fed officially in a rate cutting
cycle, the biggest negative impact was expected to be seen in the net interest
margin reported by the banks. Other upcoming major earnings releases
could potentially reflect the impact of the protracted trade war between China
and the USA. In Europe, the European Union continues to
be optimistic on the prospect of a Brexit deal. Optimism swept across the bloc except for
the FTSE 100 which struggled to maintain momentum. The International Monetary Fund threw a
spanner into the works as it flagged that the global growth would decelerate as
trade tensions continue to undermine expansion. The IMF also cut its global growth forecast
for 2019 to 3.0%. The rand was milder in today’s session as
it retreated against the greenback as emerging market currencies weakened on
the prospects of heavy retaliation by the US to Turkey. The rand slumped to a session low of
R14.91/$ before it rebounded to be recorded trading 0.17% weaker at R14.84/$ at
17:00. Gains on the JSE were led by UK focused

advanced in today’s session. The Financials index rose 0.63%, Industrials added

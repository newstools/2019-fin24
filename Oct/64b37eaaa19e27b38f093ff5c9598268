This follows a warning from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni that the mini-budget may have to shift to October 29 - having already shifted to October 30 from the previous week - to accommodate President Cyril Ramaphosa's schedule. In a statement issued on Monday afternoon, the department of finance said: "The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement will be tabled on Wednesday, Octoebr 30, 2019 after the availability of all principals who need to attend the tabling was confirmed." The mini-budget would play a "critical role" in overall budget process, the statement added.

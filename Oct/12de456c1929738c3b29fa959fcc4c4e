FNB is adding seven more branches to its existing national footprint of 619 banks in South Africa before the end of its financial year. FNB plans to open additional branches in the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Gauteng and the Western Cape, the company said on Tuesday. Last month, the labour court stopped a mass strike, planned by banking union Sasbo, to protest branch closures and retrenchments. Earlier this year Standard Bank closed 91 branches, with as many as 1 200 jobs affected, Fin24 previously reported. Absa also warned that hundreds of its jobs may be at risk as part of a restructuring initiative. But FNB has joined Capitec in expanding its number of branches. Last month, Capitec said it is opening some 21 new branches in the next few months. FNB also plans to revamp 29 of its branches in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and Free State. "The new branch design integrates self-service and personalised service, also important is the fact that the branch will heighten customer privacy during consultations with staff and at the self-service areas,” chief executive of FNB Points of Presence, Lee-Anne van Zyl, said in a statement. FNB branches service approximately 1.6 million customers per month using digital zones (self-service terminals) and in-branch service consultants.

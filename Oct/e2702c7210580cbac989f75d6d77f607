The Financial Sector Conduct Authority has warned the public
to stay away from a firm called Worldwide Investments, which it says is using a
WhatsApp group to take money from the public on the pretext that it will trade
in forex on their behalf. "The said entity uses a WhatsApp group and takes money
from the members of the public and promises to trade in forex and when itâ€™s
time to pay back they block you," the FSCA said in a statement issued on
Tuesday.  Worldwide Investments is neither an authorised Financial
Services Provider nor a representative of an authorised Financial Services
Provider, the FSCA said. There are no records of an application by Worldwide
Investments to become one, either, the regulator added. It urged consumers who wish to conduct financial services
with an institution or person to check their legitimacy beforehand with the
FSCA on either the toll free number (0800 110 443) or online. WhatsApp scams have been in the spotlight recently, with the
R200 WhatsApp stokvel making headlines. Many members of the public have
complained of joining up, only to be blocked or met with silence when the time
came for their payout. The National Stokvel Association of SA (Nasasa) has warned
South African consumers that the WhatsApp stokvel likely operates in similar
fashion to a pyramid scheme, with only the first few members to join receiving
a payout.

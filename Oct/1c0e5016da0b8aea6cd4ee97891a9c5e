A budget shortfall at Statistics South Africa could have a
negative impact on the quality of official statistics for the country, Parliament has warned. In a statement issued by Parliament, the Portfolio Committee
on Public Service and Administration said its chair Hubert James had raised its
concerns in a letter to Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu, warning that
budget cuts "place the quality of basic statistics at risk and
compromises the ability of the government to plan for the future". "Budget shortfalls experienced are at an alarming
state, rendering the department ineffective in producing quality official
statistics for the country. "Moreover, discontinuation of crucial statistical
series such as the Poverty and Living Conditions Surveys and Quarterly Labour
Force Surveys, to mention a few, affects the generation of crucial information
towards proper planning," said James. According to the committee, Stats SA has a vacancy rate of 17.2%,
with over 600 posts vacant at the end of March 2019. The entity has not made any new appointments since 2016,
apart from appointing statistician-general Risenga
Maluleke in November 2017. This is due to the Compensation of Employees
Bill not being adequately funded, the committee said. James urged the minister to
escalate the matter to the president before the mini-budget on 30 October, the committee
said. Stats SA is the country's national statistical service. It is tasked with performing the country's censuses, as well as various demographic and economic surveys. According to its website, its mission is to "lead and partner in statistical systems for evidence-based decisions". - Compiled by Marelise van der Merwe

Eskom says it is does not expect to have to institute rotational power cuts this week, after making "significant progress towards full recovery" with several generating units now again operational. In its first power alert of the new week, the utility also announced that water reserves for pumped storage schemes and diesel reserves for open cycle gas turbines had been replenished. Eskom last instituted load shedding two weeks ago, which it blamed on boiler leaks and the breakdown of a conveyor belt transporting coal to Medupi power station. This was exacerbated by delays in returning units that were on planned maintenance to service, as well as low diesel and water stocks.  It added on Monday that, while generating plant performance has improved, an unexpected shift such as an increase in unplanned breakdowns could result in load shedding at short notice Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is expected to outline the latest plans for the debt-laden utility at the mini budget on Wednesday in Cape Town.

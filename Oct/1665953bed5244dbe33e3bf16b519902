The Financial
Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) has welcomed the 15-year jail sentence handed
to David Wilmot, who stole R23m from clients under the guise that he would
trade forex on their behalf. The Port
Elizabeth Commercial Crime Court sentenced Wilmot, 47, last week. He pleaded
guilty to 153 counts of fraud, one count of contravening the Exchange Control
Act, one count of contravening the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services
Act, and one count of money laundering, FSCA said. The regulator
started investigating Wilmot, who ran a company called Nava Shore Holdings, in
2013. It found that Wilmot took money from clients under the guise that he
would trade forex on their behalf. He received R23.2
million from investors, but only R2.4 million was transferred to overseas
foreign exchange trading accounts. “The remaining
R20.8 million was used to fund Wilmot’s extravagant lifestyle, all while he
reassured investors that their money was safe and increasing in value, and when
prompted, produced fake documents as proof,” FSCA said in a statement. According to a
report in The Herald, Wilmot spent large amounts on sending his
children to private schools, as well as on a car for his wife. Some 48 people
lost money, including an  elderly woman
who were left destitute by the scam. FSCA reminded South Africans to always check that a person or entity is registered with the FSCA
to provide financial advisory and intermediary services and what category of
advice it is that the entity is registered to provide. "There are instances
where persons are registered to provide basic advisory services for a low risk
product and then offer services of a far more complex and risky nature."

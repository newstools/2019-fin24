From benefiting members of the multi-million member Zion Christian Church to Hindu devotees, the R100m Motsepe Foundation job creation fund is set to add a new dimension to efforts aimed at addressing the country's record high unemployment rate. The fund, announced by the mining mogul together with 33 religious and faith-based groups, will focus on funding employment creating initiatives through an application process administered by an appointed council. Affiliated groups would be involved in selecting deserving individuals from their organisations to apply to the fund.  Each of the 33 religious and faith-based organisations will appoint two members to serve on the Advisory Council and one member on the Sustainable Job Creation Committee. There will also be members who are experts and have experience in sustainable job creation, skills and training projects and partnerships, who will serve on the committee. Applications for funding will  be screened and assessed by the committee who would then recommend deserving applications to the advisory council for consideration. Funding would be open to people who are not members of religious groups and other donors would make donations to the fund. "Opportunities to create sustainable jobs will also arise from collaboration and partnerships with private corporations, social entrepreneurs and individuals in other sectors and industries of the South African economy," the Foundation said. Here are some of the organisations affiliated to the fund: According to the foundation, the fund would start functioning soon and reach out to potential donors, private corporations, social entrepreneurs and partners to discuss partnerships.
